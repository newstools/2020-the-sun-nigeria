The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) market capitalisation on Tuesday lost N152 billion, amidst sell pressure in 27 stocks. The market capitalisation which opened at N11.945 trillion lost N152 billion or 1.27 per cent, closing at N11.794 trillion. This was as the All-Share Index (ASI) dipped 290.49 points or 1.27 per cent to close at 22,629.92 compared with 22,920.41 on Monday. The downturn in the market’s fundamentals was impacted by losses in medium and large capitalised stocks, including Guaranty Trust Bank, Julius Berger, Zenith Bank, Lafarge Africa and Seplat. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., who commented on the development attributed it to profit taking to correct the recent sharp divergence between perceived market rallies  and economic realities. Omordion explained that negative news of further crash in crude oil prices following supply surge and  low demand due to global lockdown contributed to the price depreciation. He added that negative macro-economic indices as reflected in March inflation data released yesterday by the National Bureau of Statistics, also contributed to market sentiments. The NSE market breadth closed negative with only four securities on the price gainers chart compared to 27 losers. The gainers table was dominated by Champion Breweries and Oando in percentage terms, dropping by 10 per cent each, to close at 81k and N2.25 per share, respectively.
