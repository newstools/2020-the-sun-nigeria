The national emergency number 112 set up by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) is providing succour to Nigerians in the collective efforts tat fighting the spread of Coronavirus pandemic, also known COVID-19. Nigerians are able to call emergency response agencies/or first responders with respect to any issue they may want to report on the Coronavirus or other health-related issues and emergencies. Already, states and federal government agencies are leveraging the 112 National Emergency Number, whose calls are handledÂ  through the Emergency Communication Centre (ECC) established by the Commission across the country. The ECC project is the brainchild of NCC to enable easy communication by Nigerians with emergency first responders such as Police, Fire Service, Federal Road Safety Corps, National Orientation Agency (NOA) among others, by dialing the three-digit toll-free Number 112. On assumption of office as the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC in 2015, Prof. Umar Danbatta, quickly put machinery in place to accelerate the implementation of ECC across the country in line with the decision of the Nigerian government to enhance security of lives and property and as mandated by the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003.
