More than 1,000 graduate trainees recently recruited by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) are to assume duty on Monday 4 May, 2020, a release by the corporation’s Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Dr. Kennie Obateru, has stated. The trainees are to assume duty first, virtually while the corporation monitors the COVID-19 situation and the Federal Government’s directives to determine a date of physical assumption of duty. The release said the option of virtual assumption of duty was necessitated by the need to comply with extant protocol on social distancing and reduced number of people in workplace, among other measures that have been introduced by government as a result of the pandemic. The NNPC spokesman added that the trainees had completed online documentation, and will commence virtual onboarding on Monday. The release noted that the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, was excited about the assumption of duty of the graduate trainees, saying they are part of the succession plan to assure the future of NNPC. Kyari congratulated the successful graduate trainees being brought onboard the NNPC system, adding that much was expected of them. The assumption of duty of the graduate trainees marks the successful completion of the 2019/2020 recruitment exercise. The release stated that in pursuance of excellence, NNPC as an equal opportunity employer with business interests across the oil & gas industry value chain, will continue to recruit the best hands in order to buoy its operations nationwide.
