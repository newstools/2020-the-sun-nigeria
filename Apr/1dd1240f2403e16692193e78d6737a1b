According to its Group Chief Executive Officer, Khaled El Dokani, who stated this in a release made available to the media, the company’s “turnaround and cost-reduction strategy in 2019 financial year and the divestment of the South African business have delivered strong results.” “The decrease in net debt has significantly strengthened our balance sheet and has placed us in a vantage position to face the future,” he added. The company explained that the success of its 2018/2019 rights issue also contributed to its strong net income improvement in the 2019 fiscal year.
