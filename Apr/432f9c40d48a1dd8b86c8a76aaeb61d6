The ATP and WTA have come together to launch a new digital show, Tennis United, hosted by Grand Slam champions, Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Vasek Pospisil. The show, which will air every Friday, will feature interviews with players and other figures from throughout the sport, highlighting social media posts and charitable work within the tennis community. Hoping to fill the void left by the postponement and cancellation of this summerâ€™s Grand Slam tournaments, the first episode was aired yesterday, on Facebook and YouTube channels. The episode featured interviews with Sofia Kenin and Donna Vekic, among others. So far, this year, the French Open has been postponed from May to September, just a week after the US Open is due to finish, and WImbledon, which would have taken place in June and July, has been cancelled.
