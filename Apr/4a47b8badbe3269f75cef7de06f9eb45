FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, made this known, yesterday, while addressing  operators and managers of motor parks in Abuja. He said motorists and travellers must adhere to social distancing directive as one of the measures to curb the transmission of COVID-19 across the territory. “Motor park owners and operators know that there is a lockdown in Abuja, but it has been observed that only in the day time that the order is being observed, the park owners have created emergency parks and receive people from long journey around 2.am and 3.am. “Policemen and officers have  been deployed  to your parks, yet you people have formed new parks  in other location. If this is not checked people from other locations will bring the disease into FCT, and if we have the disease here we will take it to other locations. But our concern is to ensure that the situation is well prevented in the FCT,” he said.
