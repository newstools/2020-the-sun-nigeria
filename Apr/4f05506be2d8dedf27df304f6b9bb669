Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL), operator of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation/CNL Joint Venture (NNPC/CNL JV), has continued to operate safely, and without any Coronavirus (COVID-19) related incident in its operations. CNL affirms that as a responsible organization, one of the precautionary safeguards it has put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into its operations is the introduction of a compulsory two-week supervised quarantine for all personnel returning to work at its Escravos Operations during this period of the pandemic. CNL’s General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs, Esimaje Brikinn explained that the precautionary safeguard enables CNL to provide a controlled environment for very close monitoring of the personnel during the period of the supervised quarantine. He added that in order to make this safeguard effective, all personnel will first be required to provide a comprehensive travel history before they are placed in the supervised quarantine. Reacting to speculations that CNL quarantined some of its staff suspected of having the  Coronavirus in a hotel in Warri, Delta State, Esimaje affirmed that none of CNL’s  employees has contracted the COVID-19 virus. He clarified that based on the Coronavirus  directive issued by the Federal Government of Nigeria regarding sustained operations in  the oil and gas industry, CNL entered into arrangements with some hotels and other facilities in Warri and Lagos where their staff on rotational duties will be accommodated, and their health status monitored to ensure that they do not have the COVID-19 virus before returning to work at its Escravos Operations. According to him, the first group of personnel scheduled for quarantine were moved to the designated facilities on Friday, April 10, 2020 and other groups will follow based on the crew change schedule and the personnel will be required to strictly maintain social distancing protocols, personal hygiene, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment during the supervised quarantine period. “We are also working with the hotels and other facilities where the personnel will be placed, to ensure that the hotels and facilities maintain high levels of sanitation and follow strict adherence to all COVID 19 protocols,” he stated.
