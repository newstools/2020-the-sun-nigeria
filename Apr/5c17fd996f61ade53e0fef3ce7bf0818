However, Lawal who was also a member of the squad said it was impossible for anyone to sneak in outsiders into the players’ room without accreditation. “I don’t know what West is talking about because, at the World Cup everyone has their rooms and before you bring in anyone inside the room is very difficult because you must have an accreditation without it, it is impossible, the security guards will never accept that,” Lawal told footballlive. Lawal also revealed that, the security protocol at the World Cup was always water tight security and he would know because he often visited his teammates in their rooms. “The situation to enter into the players room if you don’t have business there is always very critical and massive. “I know this for a fact because I was always in the rooms of late Rashidi Yekini, Tijani Babangida and Daniel Amokachi, so I don’t know what Taribo West is talking about,” he said.
