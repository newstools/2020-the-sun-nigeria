The IOC President, Dr. Thomas Bach, has commended the Nigeria Olympic Committee Athletes Commission for their initiative in creating awareness on the Covid-19 pandemic, using the voice of Nigerian athletes. Bach revealed that Nigeria was the first country to do that and encouraged other NOCs to emulate Nigeria. The video of the Nigerian athletesâ€™ message was used on social media platforms by Athlete365 and the Olympic Channel. Bach made the disclosure at a conference meeting that included 200 athletes representatives, IOC Executive members as well as IOC Athlete Commission members and the Olympic Channels. Nigeria was represented in the meeting that took place online by Chairman of the Nigeria Olympic Committee Athletes Commission, Olumide Oyedeji.
