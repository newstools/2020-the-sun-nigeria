Mrs Rakiya Zubairu, Deputy Director, Public Relations, made this known in a statement on Thursday in Lagos. Zubairu said the visit was to ensure that compliance was being followed as regards the President’s directives on port operations during the lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic. She said the team visited the ENL Terminal; a general cargo terminal at the Apapa Port, and PTML Terminal, a vehicle terminal at Tin Can Island Port. “The visit to the port is to find out the challenges they are facing and ensure they cooperate in keeping their terminals open for ports operation,” she said.
