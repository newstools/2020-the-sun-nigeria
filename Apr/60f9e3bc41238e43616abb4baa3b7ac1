Chinwendu Obienyi The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) has reported that securities lending transactions stood at N34.8 billion as at April 17, 2020 as against the comparative period of 2019. Securities lending is the market practice of temporarily transferring securities, for a fee, from their holder (the lender) to another party (the borrower), with the borrower agreeing to return the securities to the lender either on-demand or at the end of the agreed loan term. It usually requires the borrower to collateralise the transaction with cash or other securities of a value equal to or greater than that of the lent securities, in order to protect the lender against counterparty credit risk. Data obtained from the NSE’s website showed that the volume of securities as at April 17, 2020 stood at 4.13 billion units compared with 61.4 million units while the value rose by N34.8 billion compared with 344.5 million.
