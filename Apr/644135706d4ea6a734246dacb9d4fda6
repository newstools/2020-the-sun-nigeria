Premier League clubs have reiterated their desire to complete the 2019/20 season – but have not yet agreed on a deadline to resume action. All top-flight clubs convened on Friday morning as the sport continues to grapple with the unprecedented coronavirus crisis gripping the world. Having previously looked at the matter of finances and player remuneration, the focus of this online meeting is understood to have been on how best to complete the remainder of the season. It was understood that some clubs were in favour of ending the campaign by June 30, with the complications of contract expiration dates among the key issues. But Premier League bosses have failed to agree a deadline, though the league have insisted it “remains our objective” to complete all matches this season. A Premier League statement said: “We are acutely aware of the distress COVID-19 is causing and our thoughts are with all those directly affected by the pandemic. “In common with other businesses and industries, the Premier League and our clubs are working through complex panning scenarios. “We are actively engaging with stakeholders, including broadcast partners, and our aim is to ensure we are in a position to resume playing when it safe to do so and with the full support of the government. “The health and well-being of players, coaches, managers, club staff, and supporters are our priority and the league will only restart when medical guidance allows. “Today’s shareholders’ meeting provided an opportunity to discuss possible scheduling models. “It remains our objective to complete the 2019-20 season but at this stage all dates are tentative while the impact of COVID-19 develops. “In response to the pandemic, the PL, our clubs and players have provided vital support for communities and the NHS and will continue to do so after matches recommence.
