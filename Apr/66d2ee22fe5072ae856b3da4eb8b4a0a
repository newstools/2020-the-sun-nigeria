Briefing newsmen on the arrest, ACP Garba, disclosed that the clerics whose names he pleaded not to be in print, were priests and residents pastors of in Warri and its environs. He explained that the pastors alongside 20 other defaulters in police custody would be made to appear before the magistrate of the mobile court set up to try cases of lockdown violators immediately after the public holiday.
