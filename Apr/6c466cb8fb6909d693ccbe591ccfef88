Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has granted amnesty to 34 inmates. This was confirmed in a statement, yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan. The amnesty is in line with the decision of the Federal Government to decongest custodial centres in the country, as part of measures to contain spread of COVID-19 pandemic. President Muhammadu Buhari had earlier approved the release of 2,600 prisoners in the country. Omipidan disclosed that 17 of the 34 inmates were granted amnesty by the governor, while the others were pardoned by the Federal Government. He further noted that the inmates were considered for amnesty on grounds of old age, ill health, sentence of three years and above with less than six months left to serve, fine of less than N50,000 and inmates who have spent 75 percent of their remaining sentences after remission and fine of less than N50,000 with inability to pay among others. “You will recall that the Federal Government has directed that all custodial centres be decongested to avoid spread of coronavirus in the county. “To decongest correctional facilities in Osun, Governor Oyetola has approved the request of the controller general of the Correctional Service and granted amnesty to 17 offenders,. “The Federal Government also granted amnesty to 17 inmates, bringing the number to 34 prisoners who are in two custodial centres in Osun. “But those who were convicted for violent offences like murder, armed robbery, terrorism, kidnapping, and rape did not benefit from the amnesty,” Omipidan said.
