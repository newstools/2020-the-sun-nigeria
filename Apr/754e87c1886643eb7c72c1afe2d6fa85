Asked by the Chief Judge if he drove against the traffic light, he said no. Having listened to his offence, the Chief Judge said she has never heard where overtaking a police officer has become an offence. She however ordered his immediate release and ordered that his impounded bus should be released to him within 24 hours. “He drove dangerously by overtaking a policeman along Sapele Road in Benin metropolis. “I don’t know, understand when overtaking has become an offence. “The defendant is hereby released unconditionally and his vehicle released to him. “The OC legal present  here shall supervise the release of his vehicle within the next 24 hours”, she ordered.
