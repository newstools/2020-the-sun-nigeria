Charles Nwaoguji The Nigerian National Technical Committee on Petroleum and Petrochemicals has reached consensus on the adoption of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) standards for Turbine and Marine Fuel as Nigeria Industrial Standard (NIS). This is in conformity to international safety regulations, limiting the sulphur content in heavy fuel oils, in order to reduce the negative effect of sulphur oxide emission from ships into the environment. At a recently convened Technical Committee (TC) meeting of experts and stakeholders in the downstream sector of the Oil and Gas Industry held at the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) Laboratory Complex, Ogba Lagos, the need for Nigeria to align with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) regulation on shipping activities globally was re-emphasised. In his welcome address, the Director General SON, Osita Aboloma re-echoed the importance of standards in protecting the health of consumers and the environment as well as facilitating fair trade practices, particularly with the growing demand for quality and safe products globally. According to him, the deliberations on the draft Standards for Turbine and Marine Fuel is aimed at meeting the aspirations in the industry to align with international best practices more so that Nigeria is a signatory to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) pollution prevention treaty. Represented by the Director, Standards Development, Mrs. Chinyere Egwuonwu, the SON Chief Executive explained that Nigeria as a signatory is expected to comply with IMO regulation with regard to the implementation of 0.50 per cent m/m maximum Sulphur content in heavy fuel oil (Bunker fuel oil) used on board during ship operations within controlled areas. Aboloma acknowledged the support of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), in convening the technical committee meeting.
