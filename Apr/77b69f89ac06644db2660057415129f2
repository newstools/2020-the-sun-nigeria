The Premier League side has the option of signing the striker in the summer, with Ighalo eager to stay at his boyhood club on a permanent basis. Ighalo had impressed since arriving in January, scoring four goals in eight appearances But Sule, who enjoyed spells at clubs across Europe and the Middle East warned that United may not look to sign Ighalo on a permanent deal, with Marcus Rashford returning from injury. “I see Odion Ighalo earning a big-money move from top European teams when his loan expires at Manchester United,” he told Goal. “I don’t think Man United is keen on retaining him because they seem not to value him enough to hand him a regular place.”
