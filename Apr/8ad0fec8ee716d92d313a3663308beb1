Paul Osuyi, Asaba The Delta State Government on Saturday commended the Nigerian Army high command for arresting two soldiers shown in an online video threatening to rape women in Warri and infect them with HIV/AIDS. Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu, who gave the commendation in a statement, said the military was a special force known for its discipline and wondered where the errant soldiers got their training and orientation from. Aniagwu said no soldier was killed in Warri and that government was concerned about where the soldiers got their information that warranted their using uncouth and uncivilised language in threatening the people of Warri in the video which had gone viral. Kudos to the Nigerian Army for a swift response.
