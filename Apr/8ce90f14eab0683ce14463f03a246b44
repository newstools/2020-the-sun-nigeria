MultiChoice Talent Factory (MTF), in partnership with the Dolby Institute, has launched Dolby audio webinars, an online learning channel for content creators in the movie industry. The webinars, eight in the series, will go live every Thursday, starting on April 16 at 12:00pm. The webinars cover a range of topics such as sound for video editors, setting-Up a 5.1 session and mix environment, Dolby Atmos Content Creation and other sound engineering topics.Â The first four sessions will focus on script analysis and planning for 5.1 productions and will be one of four webinars developed for all content creators, while the other four webinars are more technical and tailor-made for mix engineers, video editors and system integrators. The Dolby Institute develops educational programming to help creatives advance in the art of storytelling, whether they are making a film, mixing the sound for a sporting event, or designing the next-generation music experiences. Speaking on the ongoing MTF online masterclasses, Femi Odugbemi, MTF Academy Director, West Africa, explained that as the leading video entertainment provider on the continent, MultiChoice recognises the importance of understanding sound in order to tell authentic African stories.
