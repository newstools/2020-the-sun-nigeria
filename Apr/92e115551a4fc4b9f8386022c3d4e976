No one person can do it alone. Now more than ever, we need each other and we need to come together and fight this virus. “Let us observe social distancing, wash your hands regularly, follow the instructions of health authorities and report any suspected cases immediately. “Each one of us must play our part and we can win this fight against COVID-19. “I am committed to this fight, are you?” Abdul Samad added.
