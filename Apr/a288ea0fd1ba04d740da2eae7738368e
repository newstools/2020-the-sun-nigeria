The embassy also said China treats all foreign nationals equally in China, adding that China rejected differential treatment and had zero tolerance for discrimination. “To prevent and control the pandemic, we need understanding, support and cooperation from both Chinese and foreign nationals in China. We urge all foreigners in China to strictly observe local anti-epidemic regulations. China values her friendly relations with Nigeria. The embassy stands ready to keep in communication with the Nigerian side in this regard,” the Chinese Embassy said. The embassy further said to keep social distance during the pandemic, the said mobile phone with the video clip was placed on the tea table. The embassy added that any other interpretation of the scene does not conform with what was actually happened.
