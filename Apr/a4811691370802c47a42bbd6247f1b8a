Magnus Eze, Enugu Elder statesman and second republic governor of old Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo, yesterday, said that the death of Mallam Abba Kyari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, has truncated continuity in Buhari’s administration. The former Sports Minister stated this in the condolence message where he  described  Kyari’s death as a huge loss to the country. “It has truncated continuity in government and we send condolences to the president, the presidency and the federal government because it is not a loss to one person. I think that the president will be so much affected because he will now be forced to retool the cabinet and the workforce to the presidency. So, I send my condolences to the Abba Kyari family, the President for the loss of this high profile person,” Nwobodo said.
