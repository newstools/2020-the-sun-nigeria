The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) has appealed to postpaid and prepaid customers to pay their electricity bills when due and vend for energy for efficient service delivery. Its Chief Operating Officer, Mr John Ayodele, made the appeal in a statement on Friday, in which he corroborated the statement of the Minister of Power that there was no two-month free electricity as was highly publicised recently. He said without payment of electricity bills for energy consumed by customers, the industry cannot survive the revenue downturn. “At IBEDC, the current apathy to payment is not supporting our commitment to provide regular power supply and efficient service delivery to our customers. “We are therefore, imploring our customers to help us sustain this commitment by paying their bills and vending promptly, so we can fulfil our obligations to the electricity value chain as we will still pay for energy purchased. “Also, we have made huge investments in ensuring the regular power supply our customers are enjoying now, provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for staff and customers and other technical resources,” Ayodele said. He said customers could use the hassle-free alternate payments channels like Fetswallet, Quickteller, Jumia, VT Pass, Payarena, ATM cards or USSD for their convenience. “Our offices are also open Mondays to Fridays between 9a.m. to 5p.m., Saturdays, 9a.m. to 3p.m. and Sundays 11a.m. to 3p.m. for customers to pay, vend or pick up their bills, whilst obeying all COVID -19 safety protocols,” he said.
