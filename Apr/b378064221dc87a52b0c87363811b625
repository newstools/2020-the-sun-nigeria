According to SOUND, the expectation was that the Dickson would have complimented his monthly transparency briefing to explain to Bayelsans how the well over 1. 7trilion naira received under his watch for 8yrs was spent and what is left in the treasury. While commending Diri for the payments of owed workers salaries by his predecessor, the group pointed out that the controversial 2.9 billion naira car loan approved by the Bayelsa state House of Assembly for the governor coming at a moment the new government is just settling down to governance speaks volumes for the financial posture of the state.
