To maintain the social distancing rule due to the coronavirus outbreak, the April edition of the Federal Account Allocation Committee meeting would hold via video conferencing. The Forum of Commissioners for Finance of the Federation made the disclosure when theyÂ  visited the Accountant- General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, to commiserate with him over the recent fire outbreak at the Treasury House, Abuja. The Chairman of the Forum David Olofu, while delivering his solidarity message said the body was impressed by the efforts of the Accountant-General of the Federation in restoring services on the GIFMIS platform less than 24 hours after the fire outbreak. Olofu, who is also the Commissioner for Finance in Benue State, said it was quite relieving that no document related to federation accounts were destroyed in the fire outbreak. He said the Forum has had a cordial working relationship with the Office of Accountant-General of the Federation and commended him for the various financial management reforms implemented in the last five years including the migration of the operations of the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) from manual to electronic processing and distribution of Federation Revenue to the three tiers of government.
