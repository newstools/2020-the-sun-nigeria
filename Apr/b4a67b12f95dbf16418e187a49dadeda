Anthony Joshua’s world title defence against Kubrat Pulev has been postponed. The heavyweight clash was due to take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on June 20 but is the latest sporting event to fall victim to the coronavirus crisis. Promoter Eddie Hearn had previously pencilled in July 25 as an alternative date but that has not been confirmed. A statement from Matchroom read: “Anthony Joshua’s defence of his IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO heavyweight world titles against Mandatory Challenger Kubrat Pulev scheduled to take place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, June 20 has been postponed. “A new date for the event promoted by Matchroom Boxing and 258 Management in association with Top Rank and Epic Sports Entertainment is currently being worked on. “We will announce any updates in due course and continue to explore the possibility of hosting this fight at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.” The rescheduling of the fight could be complicated by the resumption of the Premier League with top-flight football suspended indefinitely. That could result in Hearn seeking a new venue with Wembley and the Principality Stadium in Cardiff the likely alternatives. There will be no boxing events in the UK until June at the earliest with Hearn hoping to stage his rescheduled June 27 show in Newcastle.He may however be forced to postpone it again, however, or hold it behind closed doors.The Matchroom chief has also had to rearrange Dillian Whyte’s clash with Alexander Povetkin in Manchester for July 4 while he is working in a new date for Dereck Chisora’s heavyweight meeting with Oleksandr Usyk.
