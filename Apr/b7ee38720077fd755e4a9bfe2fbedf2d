Liverpool has been handed a major clue as to when they might be allowed to return to Premier League action. According to a new report, the English Football League is planning to return to action on June 6 in order to complete their 2019/20 season. The Premier League and EFL are both currently indefinitely suspended until further notice due to the coronavirus outbreak. But according to a report by ESPN, the EFL has pencilled in June 6 as a return date for competitive league action for the Championship, League One and League Two.Just last week a letter was sent by the EFL to its clubs claiming it will need around 56 days to complete the current campaign and also advised them that the 2019/20 season will probably be concluded behind closed doors. Clubs in Germanyâ€™s Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 have been allowed to return to training over the last week, ahead of plans for games to take place behind closed doors from early May. The Premier League are yet to confirm their plans for its clubs, although according to the report, a video conference of all 20 Premier League sides is due to take place this Friday in order to produce a schedule for the resumption of the league in the coming weeks.
