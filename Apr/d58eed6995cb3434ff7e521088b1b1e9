The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari on the demise of his late Chief of Staff, Mallam Abba Kyari, who died last Friday . In a letter addressed to the President and signed on behalf of the Board of Directors, Executive Management and the entire staff of the Corporation, the Managing Director and Chief Executive of the Corporation, Umaru Ibrahim, described the late Abba Kyari as a patriot whose rich experience and unique competence would be sorely missed by the nation at a time the administration was committed to the rapid economic development of the country. The NDIC boss described the late Abba Kyari as an erudite and committed public servant, who was widely respected for his unwavering loyalty and commitment to the goals and aspirations of the administration. He further expressed his sadness that the late Abba Kyari departed at a time his deep knowledge and expertise were most needed by the administration in its quest to fully diversify and grow the economy. The NDIC boss prayed that the almighty Allah grant the deceased eternal peace and Aljannat-Firdausi. He also prayed for almighty Allah to grant his family and the President the strength and fortitude to bear theÂ  loss.
