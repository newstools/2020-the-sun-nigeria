Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi has relieved the Vice Chancellor of the Kogi State University, Ayangba , Prof Mohammed Abdulkadir, of his appointment. A statement by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Dr Folasade Ayoade in Lokoja on Tuesday, also announced the removal of Prof. Mohammed Atureta as the Rector of the Kogi State Polytechnic, Lokoja. Both Abdulkadir and Atureta had earlier in February been placed on indefinite suspension for ignoring the governor’s directive on Single Treasury Account (TSA).

The statement said that the appointments took immediate effect while all handing and taking over should also be completed immediately.
