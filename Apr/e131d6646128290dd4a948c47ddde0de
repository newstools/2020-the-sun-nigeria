Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Governor Hope Uzodimma has denied  speculations making rounds in the social media claiming that he has concluded plans to rename the Imo State University (IMSU) after the late Chief of Staff to the president, Abba Kyari. In a press statement by his Chief Press Secretary/media adviser, Oguwike Nwachukwu, he said  the “fake news” was the handiwork of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who he accuses of  trying to discredit his administration through falsehood and blackmail. He added that same detractors were also behind the rumour of immortalising the late CoS and claim that the governor attributed his being in power to him. Uzodimma urged the public to ignore the rumours, stressing that he would never be distracted from providing dividends of democracy to his people. The statement read: “In one of such fake statements they issued and also circulated on social media, they mischievously credited Governor Uzodimma to have said he would immortalise Kyari for making him Governor. “How would any person believe the complete thrash that Governor Uzodimma will in a condolence letter say that the late Chief of Staff made him governor of Imo State? Such a senseless and irresponsible blackmail, not done, the PDP went further to credit yet another fallacy to the CPS/Media Adviser that Governor Uzodimma will rename Imo State University after the late Kyari. “It was their desperation to deepen the propaganda and criminal intents that drove them to the latest fake news of purported renaming of Imo State University after Kyari, something that only exists in the imagination of their tiny brain’s imagination. It is sad to admit that the PDP has lost every sense of decency and fallen to the beastly level of denigrating the memory of the dead. One is not shocked, therefore, to notice that even in their desperation, the PDP could go so low to commit the sacrilege of dragging the name of a late distinguished statesman into gutter politics.”
