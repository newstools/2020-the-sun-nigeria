All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has praised prominent celebrity journalist, Mr. Mayowa Abiodun Akinpelu, popularly known as Mayor Akinpelu, for his vital contributions to the media, good governance and equitable society. In a congratulatory message to Mayor Akinpelu on his 60th birthday, Asiwaju Tinubu described him as a progressive politician and a collaborator who, through informed analysis and critique, had helped shape public issues and policies. A statement signed by his Media Office, Mr. Tunde Rahman, read: “Mayor Akinpelu is on record to have come into journalism by coincidence, when, as a prison official at Kirikiri Maximum Security Prison, he came in contact with two prominent journalists. He later went on to make a tremendous success of the profession. “Akinpelu quickly set himself apart for his rigour, unique style and exquisite taste. He was one of those who pioneered celebrity journalism in the country. He prayed Almighty Allah to grant him many more years, robust health and the required energy to continue to contribute positively towards the advancement of good governance and equitable society.
