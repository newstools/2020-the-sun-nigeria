We cannot just send them into the community without medical test, that is what we are doing now. “Currently, those we have received are from Gombe but they are from Kanam and Wase Local Government Areas, we have quarantine them to make sure that they are medically feet before we hand them over to their Local Government and families.” He explained that the Almajiris that they have profiled for returning to their respective states of origin will have to undergo medical test to satisfy their Heath condition. Inusa said the committee will mop up all the Almajiris across the 17 council  areas and profile them according to their states of origin and will be returned after a medical test is conducted on them.
