The coach of Bulgaria, Georgi Dermendzhiev, has been given a six-month contract extension, the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) said on Tuesday. The extension will allow him to guide the Balkan country in the Euro 2020 qualifying playoff semi-final against Hungary. The former Ludogorets and Levski Sofia boss was appointed as the head coach in October, replacing Krasimir Balakov. Balakov resigned a few days after a 6-0 defeat by England when some supporters taunted the visitors with Nazi salutes and monkey chants, prompting match officials to halt the game twice. The BFU said the 65-year-old Dermendzhiev has volunteered to take a 30 percent reduction in his salary, reflecting the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dermendzhiev led Ludogorets to three consecutive Bulgarian league titles between 2015 and 2017. His side became the first Bulgarian team to register a UEFA Champions League group stage victory when they beat Switzerlandâ€™s Basel in 2014. Bulgaria were scheduled to face Hungary, hoping to end a 16-year wait to reach the finals of a major tournament, on March 26. But the game was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
