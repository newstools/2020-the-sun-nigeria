Doris Obinna, Lagos The Nigeria Union of Journalists’ (NUJ) national secretariat has raised concerns over the Chinese Medical Mission on coronavirus (COVID-19) to Nigeria. In a statement jointly signed by its president, Chris Isiguzo and secretary, Shuaibu Leman, respectively, the national union raised alarm over the decision of the Federal Government to bring Chinese medical doctors to Nigeria to fight COVID-19, even when Nigerian doctors are doing exceptionally well in fighting the outbreak. “We caution that it will be counterproductive to bring in Chinese doctors. “While some have applauded the way and manner China contained the virus in Wuhan – the only Chinese city to be so affected – we hasten to note that there is more to this charade than is being let out by the Chinese authorities, and we reject a situation where Nigeria will be used as a Guinea pig for any experiment. “It is pertinent to plead with the Federal Government to stop this medical team from coming to Nigeria because of the Italian example where there was an inexplicable spike in COVID-19-related deaths when the Chinese doctors arrived the country. “The FG should as a matter of urgent concern investigate the allegation that what is happening today is associated with the launching of the 5G communication network, as Nigerians are becoming more agitated over the issue, which cannot be swept under the carpet. “We urge the FG to be more proactive in dealing with these emerging issues because any mistake made will be catastrophic,” the statement read.
