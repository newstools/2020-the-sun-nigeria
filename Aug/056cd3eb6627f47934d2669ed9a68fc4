Meanwhile, the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) has raised the alarm that the recent ban imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on third party arrangement will hinder trade and reduce the volume of import coming into the country. According to the Association, there is need for CBN to critically look into its directives on Form-M to avoid the return of pre-shipment destination inspection at the nation’s ports. Speaking yesterday at a media briefing in Lagos, Vice President of ANLCA, Kayode Farinto, lamented that the ploy by the CBN to ban third party arrangement on Form-M will end up taking away jobs from Nigerians. He added: “The CBN issued a statement recently banning third party participation in Form-M issuance. This was disclosed in a circular dated August 24,2020. “The CBN said that to ensure prudent use of foreign exchange resources and eliminate incidences of over-invoicing, transfer pricing, double handling charges, and avoidable costs that are ultimately passed to the average Nigerian consumers, thus eradicating third party involvement in Form-M.” According to him, whoever signed the circular does not have the interest of Nigerians at heart because what the policy means is that there won’t be third party involvement in Form-M again.
