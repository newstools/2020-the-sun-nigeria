The Speaker of the Assembly Frank Okoye had on Wednesday raised the alarm that the governor of Imo State Hope Uzodinma and some stakeholders are planning to invade the assembly to bring a fake mace in iconjuction with the mpeached deputy speaker Yekini Idiiaye to forcefully take over the Assembly. The Speaker while calling for the support of Edo people said such violent invasion will be resisted. The man of God called on prominent people in Edo State including the oba of Benin to immediately wade into the crisis in a bid to settle it so that it may not degenerate. He also warned the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, to thread softly, saying ‘there is a grand conspiracy against him.’ According to him, ‘the Lord says Oshiomhole should pray seriously against a terrible sickness, he must, pray and be very watchful; a word is enough for the wise,’ he added.
