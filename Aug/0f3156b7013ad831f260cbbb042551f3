Okey Sampson, Umuahia Former givernor of Abia State and senator representing Abia North, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu on Thursday attended the inauguration of the first  Auxiliary Bishop  of Catholic Diocese of Umuahia, Monsignor Michael Kalu Ukpong. This is even as the senate Chief Whip has urged the people of Abia to ensue acrimony and allow peace to reign. Kalu’s visit to the Mater Dei Cathedral, Umuahia, caused traffic gridlock around the area as commercial tricycle operators and residents blocked the adjourning streets in an attempt to catch a glimpse of the senate Chief Whip.
