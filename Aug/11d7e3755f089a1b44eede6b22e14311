Out of the sum, N10 billion claimed to have been used for execution of projects by the commission during the years in review was discovered to be false as the acclaimed projects were non existing according to the report. The interim forensic audit report which our correspondent obtained, was carried out by Corporate Dev.& Assets Mgt Ltd (CADAM-ANE), duly commissioned by the State government.

Further shocking details are that while only 44 transactions under the sub head of unexplained expenditure and on line transfers were carried out in 12 years (2007 to 2018) 88 of such illegal transactions were carried out in less than 8 months (June 2019 to January 2020) The report also showed that the overall expenditure profile of ISOPADEC within the period under review witnessed an unprecedented high in seven months than in any single year in 12 years.

But between June 2019 to January 2020 alone, less than 8 months, the commission spent N3.3billion. The report also revealed that huge sums of money were paid to contractors without following due process in direct violation of extant laws, huge serial on line transfers were also made to either unknown or unidentified recipients. It further shows that payments to contractors were made without any guaranteed APG or certificates earned and that there was no project history, tender records or evidence of approvals from the board as well as lack of adherence to existing protocols on award of contract above N1million.
