Neymar has sent a clear message to Barcelona that he is finally settling down in Paris after three turbulent years. The attacker left the Nou camp in a world record £198million deal and has constantly been linked with a return. A number of Barcelona’s high-profile stars, including Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique, have pleaded with Neymar to return. Some of the Catalan club’s senior players were willing to defer some of their wages to facilitate the transfer. Paris Saint-Germain stood firm to keep hold of the Brazilian and are hoping he can lead them to Champions League glory. Ahead of the return to European action next week, Neymar has sent a clear message to Barcelona not to disrupt his side’s preparation by making any approach as he is now happy in the French capital.
