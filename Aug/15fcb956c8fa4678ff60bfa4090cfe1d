On his part while constituting the Committee, after receiving the screening report from the Executive Secretary of the Board, the State Governor, Samuel Ortom announced that the committee would be headed by Commissioner for Education, Professor Dennis Ityavyar. He urged the Committee to ensure that those who had milked the board through ghost workers be identified and prosecuted, even as he directed that the ghost names be immediately deleted from the payment voucher. Governor Ortom also charged the TSB boss to ensure that the names to be deleted do not find their way back on the payroll.
