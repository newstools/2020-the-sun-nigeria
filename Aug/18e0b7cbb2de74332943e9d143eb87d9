Speaking on the results, Managing Director, BUA Cement, Yusuf Binji,  said the impressive performance in 2020, despite the challenging operating environment occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic, was a pointer to the value and strength of the BUA Cement brand and product offerings as well as an indication of the excellent implementation of the company’s Business Continuity Plan which ensured the brand was able to withstand the impact of the pandemic in the period under review. “Our resilient performance continues to showcase the value and strength in our product offering alongside our strategic business model. In a bid to further drive cost efficiencies and sustainability, we entered into strategic alliances for the supply of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) at the Kalambaina, Sokoto State and the management of our mining operations. Given these deliberate and strategic choices among other cost management efforts, we continue to combine development and innovation into our offerings and activities.”, Binji added. On the impact of the pandemic on the business, Binji noted that the company remains quite optimistic about the future. “This is because it affords us not only with the opportunity to further evolve our business model but also provides an opportunity for accelerated development. We will continue to push to new markets aided by a focused distribution strategy”, he said. Also commenting on  his firm’s performance, Group Managing Director, Dangote Cement, Michel Puchercos, said the company continued in its strong position despite the economic downturn facing the world economy due to COVID-19. Puchercos noted that although April was greatly impacted by lockdowns and restrictions across the company’s operations, it experienced a strong quarter. “We achieved a record high volume and EBITDA margin in Pan-Africa of 4.7Mt and 21.7 per cent respectively. Group EBITDA was up slightly despite the impact of COVID-19. I am particularly pleased to announce that Dangote Cement shipped its first clinker cargo to Senegal from our new cement terminal in Apapa, Lagos. It has been a long journey for Nigeria, from being one of the largest bulk importers of cement to being self-sufficient in cement production, and now an exporter of clinkers. “We are on track to ensure West and Central Africa are cement and clinker independent, with Nigeria as the main supply hub. We want to continue developing regional and continental trade between the ECOWAS countries and beyond”, he added.
