We look forward to future collaborations with other bodies in government and private sector.” WapTV is a 24-hour family entertainment channel, showing the best of drama, comedy, music, movies, news, events, reality shows, celebrity interviews, game shows, fashion, religion, cooking shows, and many more on an extensive network of DStv 262, StarTimes 116, GOtv 102, StarSat 189, Play 275, and MyTV; across Nigeria and several other African countries.
