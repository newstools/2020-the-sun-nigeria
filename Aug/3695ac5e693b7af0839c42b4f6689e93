Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu The Executive Director, MOVERS Nigeria, a pressure group championing transparency and accountability in government, Mr Ifeanyichukwu Okonkwo, has thrown the weight of his group behind Mammam Daura’s suggestion for competence rather rotation to determine who becomes Nigeria’s next president come 2023. Daura had, in an interview with BBC Hausa Service last Tuesday, said that the most qualified Nigerian. regardless of zone of origin, should succeed his uncle, President Muhammadu Buhari, in 2023. Though many had opposed Daura’s view, Okonkwo, a former governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Anambra State, said that not only is he supporting merit, he is also canvassing for the scrapping of the quota system as the basis for being considered for the National Assembly. ‘Mamman Daura’s suggestion is a welcome development. I am in support of Daura’s suggestion. The only thing he did not add which I will amend to add is we must also remove the quota system so that the federal character remains but there will be no quota any more. ‘Then, the finality is that we will now have to restructure power distribution in Nigeria. First, the number of states in the north and in the South must be balanced. Secondly, the local government must be removed as the basis of going to the parliament; it will be by allocation to states. ‘No more local government in the allocation of resources; so let us pursue excellence. Nigeria needs excellence,’ he said.
