Akume, in a statement by the Deputy Director, Press, Osagie Jacob Julie, lamented the plethora of challenges plaguing the educational sector but pointed out that, “If our resources are properly managed, TETFUND can be better placed to support university education in the country. “Also with harnessing of resources, the Federal Government can deliver in the provision of basic amenities especially in the education sector.” The former lawmaker also called on universities that were yet to key into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) to do as migration of universities to IPPIS for salary payments would guarantee “effectiveness and efficiency of payroll administration.
