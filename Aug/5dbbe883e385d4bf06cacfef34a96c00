It’s going to be a fair trial for all players and only the best will make the team. As much as possible, care must be taken in managing the players. I also think that we have good teams that can finish on the podium given the right environment.” Awogu noted that his confidence stems from the fact that Nigeria has got the talents to prosecute the Olympic backed by the NBBF board led by Musa Kida. “I must give credit to the NBBF president, Musa Kida for the leadership he has provided as well as members of the board for the sacrifices everyone has made.
