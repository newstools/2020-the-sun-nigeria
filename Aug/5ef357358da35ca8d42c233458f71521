World Athletics has issued a reminder of the rule, which reduces the maximum allowable height of soles in spiked track shoes. Member federations and event organisers were reminded about the recently introduced rule five, which governs competition shoes. The amended rule, which puts a sole height limit of 25 millimetres on all shoes worn in track events of 800 metres and above in distance, came into force on July 28. The height limit was also reduced to 20mm for events below 800m. World Athletics reminded organisers that national championships and other domestic competitions must be held under the governing body’s technical and competition rules. This means that rule five must be applied in full for the competition results to be recognised as valid. Member federations were also reminded that it is their responsibility to ensure that all athletes, officials and competition organisers are aware that rule five must be applied in full. If a member federation or competition organiser permits an athlete to compete in non-compliant shoes, the athlete’s individual results from the competition will be marked in World Athletics’ records and statistics as invalid.
