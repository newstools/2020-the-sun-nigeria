Romanus Okoye The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has written to President Muhammadu Buhari, defending himself against and denying allegations of corruption levelled against him in the media. Malami in the letter listed all his sources of income which he declared in the assets declaration he filed with the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) in 2015 when he was appointed minister, and restated when he was reappointed last July. The Minister stated that he was already a wealthy man, having been engaged in enterprises such as hotels, farms, food production and processing, restaurants and legal services. The letter follows allegations by a group that Mr Malami may have soiled his hand, an action the Attorney-General described as campaign of calumny by his detractors to tarnish his reputation, adding that he has sued one of the online publishers. The letter to the President reads: ‘I have taken a personal decision to seek remedy from the court as a result of the series of derogatory contents so published against me. In the same vein, I have written the Inspector-General of Police to investigate the matter. ‘I, nonetheless, felt it is imperative to write Your Excellency on the subject above.
