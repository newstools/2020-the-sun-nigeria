Meanwhile, the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF) has canvassed for more funding  for security agencies to address increasing insecurity in the country. Chairman of the forum and Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu while speaking to journalist shortly after leading a delegation of the forum to Borno State governor on Sunday noted that inadequate funding was affecting the efforts of the security agencies to adequately deal with the security situation in the country. “There is need for more funding for all the security agencies. There is no doubt as a nation even our budgets is small compared to our needs, a country of 200 million people, a country like ours; the current budget less than N30 billion is inadequate,” he said.
