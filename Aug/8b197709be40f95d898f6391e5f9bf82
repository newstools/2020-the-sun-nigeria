Mikel Arteta aiming to seal place in Europe as Frank Lampard bids to win his first piece of silverware as a manager in Wembley showdown between old rivals.    5min: Wow! Chelsea take the lead! It was a flowing move from Frank Lampard’s men, and Christian Pulisic finished beautifully. Mason Mount cut a ball across the box for Olivier Giroud after a drive forward from midfield, and the frontman cleverly flicked across to Pulisic. The American did the rest, cutting beyond the defender and poking home. Goooallllll! Chelsea on the lead,  1-0 Olivier Giroud was fuming with his team-mate and believed he could have been slotted clear on goal instead. Lightning start to this one. 3min: The first chance has fallen to Arsenal! Ainsley Maitland-Niles did superbly to wriggle his way into a crossing position from a long punt forward, and his delivery was nodded wide by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.
