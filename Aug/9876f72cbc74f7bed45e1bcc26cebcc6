As the last quarter of the year {also called the ‘ember’ months} approaches, the Zone 4 Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps {FRSC}, Assistant Corps Marshal Kayode Olagunju, has cautioned motorists in the area to be safety-conscious in order to ensure accident-free motoring in the area during the season. Dr. Olagunju whose zone covers Plateau, Benue and Nasarawa states, enjoined road users to be mindful of the usual increase in mobility during the period which could also result to high incidence of road traffic crashes (RTC), if they are not safety-conscious. The Zonal Commander spoke shortly after the conclusion of mobile court sittings conducted in Plateau, Benue and Nasarawa states, which convicted 131 traffic offenders for varying violations. One of the mobile courts presided over by Isa Zalla in Pankshin, convicted 30 offenders arraigned.
