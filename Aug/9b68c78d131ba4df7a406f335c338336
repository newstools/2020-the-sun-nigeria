From Aidoghie Paulinus , Abuja After over three weeks in isolation since he tested positive for COVID-19, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, has tested negative for the virus. Onyeama who earlier tested positive after a throat irritation, disclosed his new status on his Twitter handle, @GeoffreyOnyeama. Onyeama expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, relations, friends and colleagues, including religious leaders and well wishers for their care, prayers, fasting and messages of support while in isolation. “By the very special grace of God, my latest #COVID19 test result came back negative after three weeks isolation. “I am eternally grateful to my family, the C-in-C and VP, the medical team, relations, friends, colleagues, religious leaders and numerous well-wishers, who through their care, prayers, fasting, messages of support and encouragement never let me walk alone,” Onyeama said. Recall that Onyeama had on July 19, 2020, announced on his Twitter handle that he tested positive for COVID-19 after undergoing his fourth COVID-19 test. With the outcome of the result, the minister, a member of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 set up by President Buhari, became the first minister to test positive for the virus. “Did my fourth COVID-19 test yesterday at the first sign of a throat irritation and unfortunately this time, it came back positive. That is life! Win some lose some. Heading for isolation in a health facility and praying for the best,” Onyeama had said.
