The President said, “I have no doubt that you might have prior and in-depth knowledge of Nigeria’s huge potential which you will hopefully see for yourselves. “I therefore, urge you to go around the country, see things for yourselves and report to your home governments. This is important as you all are representatives of both your sending and host states.’’ The President said Nigeria will remain steadfast in pursuing deeper and valuable relations among nations, without discrimination.
