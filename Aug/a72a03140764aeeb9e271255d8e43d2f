 Obaseki made the call on Friday in Ukhuse in Owan West Local Government Area, when addressing members of the Party (PDP) at the Ward 6 campaign ground. “On the 19th of September, come out and vote massively for PDP and make sure you stay back in your polling units to defend your vote to avoid manipulation. “My coming to Ukhuse is a home coming, Four years ago I couldn’t get to you people because of bad road, but I made sure I constructed the road for easy transportation. “Now, you can now move your commodities to the market and other village to sell. “I need to buy more tractors for mechanized farming because farming now is very important to Nigeria. We want to phase out the old way of farming, we want to make farming more attractive to our youths. “The development of Edo is in your hands. Come out with your Permanent Voters Card (PVC) and vote PDP and I will make sure I keep all my promises to you all,’’ he said. (NAN)
