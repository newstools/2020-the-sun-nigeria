The child victim had gone to use the convenience when the suspect sneaked in and forcibly had canal knowledge of her, Daily Sun has learned. ‘The victim cried out of the toilet after she was defiled and the man denied ever doing it, but the CCTV installed in the premises captured him sneaking into the room after the victim cried out of the toilet,’ a source said. ‘The man denied the incident until the CCTV reviewed that he went into the room while the girl was still there.’ Another source stated that upon seeing the footage of the CCTV, the suspect began to apologise for his action until police operatives were invited to arrest him. Confirming the incident, police spokesperson DSP Onome Onowakpoyeya said the suspect was caught in CCTV footage after earlier denying the allegation.
