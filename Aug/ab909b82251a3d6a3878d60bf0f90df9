Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial aspirant in Lagos State, on Tuesday said he was optimistic his party would clinch victory in the upcoming Lagos East Senatorial District by-Election. Gbadamosi spoke with newsmen at the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, shortly after obtaining the PDP nomination and expression of interest forms for the senatorial district election. He expressed his belief that the party would do all it could to ensure the will of the people prevailed in the by-election. “Whatever it takes for the will of the people to prevail is what we will do within all legal boundaries,” he said. Gbadamosi said he had the intention of offering quality representation for the people of Lagos and Nigerians at large, hence his aspiration. “Since the first republic, it has been a problem of quality representation except for a short four years term that was served by one of our senators from Ikorodu. “We have taken this opportunity. It is unfortunate that the opportunity has to come in a manner that it did. May the soul of the departed rest in peace. “We have no choice than to carry on to give our people that are still living  the best that we can. “That is why I am contesting to give our people the best that we can in all of the five Local Government Areas  that constitute Lagos East Senatorial District; that is, Ikorodu, Epe, Ibeju-Leki, Kosofe, Somolu,” he said. Gbadamosi said that his mission was to ensure that laws negatively affecting people were amended, if he was elected as a senator by Oct. 31. “We will be providing quality representation for all  Nigerians, especially my people of Lagos, and specifically the people of Lagos east,” he said. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Oct. 31 to conduct by-election for the Lagos East Senatorial Constituency election. This follows the death of  Sen. Bayo Oshinowo, who was representing the district at the senate, in June. (NAN)
