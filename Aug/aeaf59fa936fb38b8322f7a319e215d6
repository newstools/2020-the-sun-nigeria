Edo State Government has urged residents to ensure strict compliance to coronavirus pandemic guidelines to prevent spread of the virus amid electioneering for the September 19, 2020 governorship election as death toll for the virus hits 100. Commissioner for Health, Patrick Okundia, who decried the alarming rate of community spread of the virus, said the state has recorded 2,398 confirmed cases and 11,871 suspected cases, adding: “Contact tracing, line-listing and contact monitoring of contacts of confirmed cases is ongoing by the state’s surveillance pillar.” Okundia said the state government will continue to intensify efforts to contain the pandemic and protect its citizens, especially the elderly who are most vulnerable to the virus. Commending the resilience and commitment of health workers in the front-line of government’s effort to contain the virus, the commissioner said 2,121 patients have been managed and discharged from various isolation facilities in the state. “Edo has continued to record a steady increase in mortality rate for the virus, with the toll rising to 100. This is of serious concern to the state government because many of these deaths could have been prevented if citizens adhered to COVID-19 prevention regulations. “As we continue to ramp up efforts to curtail the spread of the virus and protect Edo people, we urge everyone to observe the set guidelines to contain the pandemic. “Amid electioneering campaigns ahead of the September 19 governorship election, it is important that we exercise caution and observe the regulatory guidelines for prevention of COVID-19 to remain safe and healthy,” he said.
