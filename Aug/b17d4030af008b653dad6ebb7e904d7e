A mixed relay cross-country race has been proposed for inclusion at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Each team would consist of two men and two women, with each member running two legs of the 2.5 kilometre course, under the proposal announced by World Athletics on Thursday. World Athletics said it would meet with the Paris 2024 organising committee to work out details of the proposal, which would bring cross-country racing back to the Games after a 100-year absence.
