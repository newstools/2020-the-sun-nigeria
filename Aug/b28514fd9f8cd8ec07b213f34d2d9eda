Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has urged Nigerian youths to rally support for President Muhammadu Buhari who he described as the most youth friendly Nigerian president so far. Speaking during a courtesy visit in his office in Owerri by the Coalition of Ethnic Nationality Youth Leaders of Nigeria, the governor recalled how President Buhari has consistently rolled out policies aimed at empowering the youths such as the N75b he recently approved for the empowerment of Nigerian youths and the Youth Investment Fund. The governor also recalled the programmes of the federal government to cushion the devastating effects of COVID-19 induced hardship on the youths, his honesty, leadership style and modesty which he said should inspire the youths to be good leaders of tomorrow. “The future of the country belongs to the youths. So if you get it right then Nigeria has got it right but if you miss the track, then it means Nigeria has lost its way. So you need to remain focused and you are lucky that you have a president of the country who is encouraging you and making you have faith in your country”, the governor declared. Uzodimma also urged the youths to give all their support to the president because he has shown that he means well not only for the youths but also for the entire Country, adding that the worst critics of the President will give him kudos for his visionary agricultural policies making the country self sufficient in food production, particularly in rice production. Earlier in his address, the leader of the youths, Mohammed Salihu Dunlam said they were in Owerri to encourage the governor to continue with his exemplary conduct as a detribalized Nigerian. He said: “We see you as a unifying factor for national unity because your ideas, leadership, guidance and friendship are exemplary”.
