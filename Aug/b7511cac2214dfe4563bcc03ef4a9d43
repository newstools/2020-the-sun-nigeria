Aloysius Attah, Onitsha The palace of the Eze Uzu 111 of Awka, yesterday, denied that there was a rift between the kingdom and Governor Willie Obiano as well as between some traditional rulers and Anambra State government. Obi Austin Ndigwe who spoke through the palace secretary, Chief Anekwe C. Emenike said he was quoted out of context in a recent interview where he reportedly said that Obiano cannot intimidate Anambra traditional rulers. He said his only interest was for the rapid development of Awka by the government so that it attains the status of a befitting state capital. “The Obi of Awka never said that the state government cannot intimidate Anambra monarchs. The Eze uzu Awka 111 said emphatically that nobody can intimidate him and that he was crowned the Eze uzu Awka by Awka and that he remains same. As the royal father of Awka ancient kingdom, Eze uzu Awka’ s concern and request is for the governor of Anambra to improve the development of Awka, the capital city of Anambra. Awka has been long neglected with decaying infrastructure and government attention is urgently needed,” he said. The palace, therefore, warned that the Awka traditional institution should not be dragged into the politics of Anambra State and urged accurate media reportage noting that  Awka Kingdom has appropriate channels of communication with government authorities.
