Around 3,000 police will be deployed on the Champs- Elysees and outside Paris Saint-Germain’s stadium to prevent wild fan celebrations concerns as the team look to become only the second French club to win the Champions League today. Paris’ Champs-Elysees avenue will be pedestrianised this evening and wearing face masks will be compulsory, of officials said. Several thousand people flocked to the famed avenue on Tuesday night to celebrate the Ligue 1 champions reaching the final of Champions League for the first time after they beat RB Leipzig. “Police will be deployed to the Champs-Elysees and the area around PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium on Sun- day night, when PSG meet German champions Bayern in Lisbon”, France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. “They will hand out face masks to anyone not wearing one. “I’m calling on everyone to act responsibly to ensure (the event) can be an expression of joy and not a source of problems for Parisians.”
