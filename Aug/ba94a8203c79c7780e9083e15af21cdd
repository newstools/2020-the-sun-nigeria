The Edo State APC governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has promised to give traditional rulers their rightful place in his government to address the issue of insecurity in the state, by enhancing their capacity as revered leaders of their various communities. He made the pledge yesterday while addressing traditional rulers from  Edo Central senatorial district in a meeting held at the Palace of the traditional ruler of Igueben, HRH Ehizogie Eluojierior I, before flagging off his campaign rally in the area. Emphasizing the high premium his manifesto, Simple Agenda, places  on the security of lives and property of all Edo citizens, Ize-Iyamu, promised not only to involve the traditional rulers in his government, but provide them the enablement so they support the security of their communities. “Traditional rulers are not people you only see when you want to do elections. They are people that you must consult regularly. They are people you involve in governance. They are people you must take their decisions seriously. “And many of you know that when I become governor, traditional rulers will get their due respect. I know that a lot of our traditional rulers have been kept at bay”, he said. The APC candidate argued that the spate of insecurity of lives and property especially that of farmers in the locality will be addressed with his government providing adequate funding of security agencies as well as Vigilante groups in communities. On the issue of funding for the state-owned Ambrose Alli University, AAU, Ekpoma, Pastor Ize-Iyamu blamed the reduction of subvention due it from N250million to N96million monthly by the Obaseki government for its inability to meet its obligations to workers.
