Austrian Foreign Minister, Alexander Schallenberg, on Friday supported calls from other European Union member states to consider sanctions against Belarus. The call for sanction is in response to a violent crackdown on post-election protests. The sanctions would have to be targeted against those responsible for the violence against protesters, arbitrary detentions and internet blockades, Schallenberg told ORF radio. Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, claimed victory in Sundayâ€™s presidential election with around 80 per cent of the vote. The victory claim is triggering clashes between security forces and opposition supporters in which at least two protesters have died, and thousands, being detained. EU foreign ministers will meet on Friday at 1300 GMT via a video call to discuss sanctions. Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, said the election should be rerun. (Reuters/NAN)
