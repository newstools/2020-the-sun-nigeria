Godwin Tsa, Abuja The National Judicial Council (NJC) has recommended four judicial officers for elevation to the bench of the Supreme Court. Two out of the four nominees were members of last year’s presidential election petition court recommended to the President Muhammadu Buhari. They are Justices Abdu Aboki and Mohammed Garba, who headed the five-man court. Justice Garba led the five-man Presidential Election Petition Court, which heard the petition filed by the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, challenging the victory of Buhari at the last year’s poll. The court in a unanimous judgment dismissed Atiku’s petition and affirmed Buhari’s victory at the poll. Others on the list are Justices Tijjani Abubakar and Mohammed Saulawa.
