The match will kick off at 8:00pm live on SuperSport 3, DStv channel 223 City hold a 2-1 lead from the first leg at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu and are being tipped to advance – though Real are a different beast compared to back in February when the Citizens won in Madrid, with Zinedine Zidane’s side having claimed a first La Liga title since 2017. Juventus, fresh from claiming their ninth successive Serie A title will have to dig deep to overturn a 1-0 deficit against Olympique Lyon – though the French side will likely be undercooked, having not played a competitive game since March after the 2019-20 Ligue 1 side was scrapped entirely when the worldwide pandemic struck.
