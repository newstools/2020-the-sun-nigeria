The Commonwealth Games in Birmingham has been dealt an embarrassing blow after organisers were forced to scrap plans to build the £500million Athletes’ Village. Competitors and staff involved in the 2022 event will now be housed in student accommodation at the universities of Birmingham and Warwick, as well as the National Exhibition Centre. The decision to move away from the Perry Barr site, which was due to be transformed into housing after the Games, was taken after organisers conceded it could not be delivered on time-blaming the delay on the Covid-19 pandemic. There were also concerns that the development was going to cost £100million more than planned, with the Government having already warned Birmingham 2022 chiefs they must stick to their overall £778million budget. Ian Reid, Birmingham 2022 chief executive, said: “We recognise that this new model is a move away from the historic norm. “Birmingham and the West Midlands is extremely fortunate to have superb alternate facilities and we are making this decision now, with two years to go, to de-risk the project, ensure delivery for athletes and teams and secure the legacy of new housing and transport infrastructure in Perry Barr.”
