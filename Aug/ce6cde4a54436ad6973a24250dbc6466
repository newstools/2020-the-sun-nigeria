Magnus Eze, Enugu Two men have been abducted by gunmen believed to be herders in Enugu. It was gathered that the victims, a lawyer simply identified as Mr John, and his businessman friend, were on Friday evening abducted along Ugwogo-Isi-Uzo road and taken to an unknown destination. The duo hail from Isi-Uzo local government area of Enugu State. Information we gathered indicated the two abducted men had travelled in a Sienna bus to their village and were returning to Enugu with Johnâ€™s family when the heavily armed kidnappers accosted them around Ora River, the boundary between Enugu East and Isi-Uzo Local Government Areas. The two men were ordered out of the vehicle and taken away while the wife to one of the victims and children were left stranded on the road Those who first crossed the scene shortly after the incident, at about 7 pm, said the kidnappers used vehicles to block the way and shot sporadically, with bullets pallets littering the scene. The families of the abducted persons say that the kidnappers are yet to make contact with them as at press time, but it was learnt that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has ordered that the surrounding bushes of the area be combed. The Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, did not immediately respond to our reporter for comment on the matter.
