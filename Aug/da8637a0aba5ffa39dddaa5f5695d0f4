Bolaji Okunola Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen has beaten twenty two of twenty six acquired Napoli stars to emerge the club’s third highest annual salary earner. Daily SunSports revealed the current Africa’s most expensive player is only behind two players as players with the highest annual salary cap in Napoli ahead next season in Serie A. Despite his €70million mega move from French side, Lille, it was gathered the striker is behind teammates, Kalidou Koulibaly, Lorenzo Insigne but on the same salary cap with Mexican Rodrigo Lazano. Osimhen’s annual take home stands at €4.5million, behind the club’s highest earner, Koulibaly who rakes in €6million annually. Next to Koulibali is Insigne at 4.6million while he ties with Lazano on €4.5million. The 2019 AFCON bronze medalist is rated higher than twenty two other notable stars which include Krystian Milik, former Real Madrid player, Jose Callejon, Dries Mertens and erstwhile Arsenal goal stopper, David Ospina. The goal machine will resume action next month when the 2020/2021 Serie A season resumes on the proposed September 19 date.
