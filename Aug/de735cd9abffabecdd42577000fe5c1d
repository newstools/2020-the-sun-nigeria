 Four Algerian aircraft with food packages, necessary medical equipment and groups of doctors aboard are preparing to leave for Beirut, according to the office. Algeria will also send a ship carrying construction material to help Lebanon rebuild the sites that the blast destroyed, the statement read. Meanwhile, rescue groups from the European countries, Arab states and Russia continue to arrive in the Lebanese capital to help the latter deal with the blast’s implications, a Sputnik correspondent reported from the scene. Around 50 relief personnel from the Netherlands, including specialists with rescue dogs, have arrived at the Beirut international airport on a red-eye flight. According to one of the Dutch rescue staff members, the country’s teams will stay in Lebanon for 10 days to help search for people buried in the rubble. “If our further help is not required, we will leave,” a Dutch relief team member told Sputnik. Alongside the Dutch teams, three Russian emergency aircraft out of five, planned to be sent to Lebanon, have already landed at the Beirut airport in a bid to provide support to the country’s authorities in the wake of the massive explosion. Russian rescue staff with a mobile hospital and search dogs, as well as medical personnel who are able to undertake complex surgical procedures, have arrived, a Sputnik correspondent reported. Middle East states, such as Iran, Qatar, Kuwait and Iraq, have also already assisted Lebanon by sending medical and humanitarian aid.  Half of the city’s buildings have been damaged, and hospitals are overcrowded due to the large number of blast victims.
