INEC has also come up with a code of conduct and rules of engagement for the security agencies. “The code of conduct and rules of engagement will be distributed to all the security personnel deployed for the election to guide them properly.” Eyinla added that the commission had designed an election policy within the context of the conduct of election in a pandemic. “We are aware that as at today, Edo has 2,399 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and recorded a total of 100 deaths. “So with these statistics from the NCDC, INEC has come up with a policy book with strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures and guidelines on the election so that everyone including the media can be guided. “The number of registered voters in Edo remains 2, 210,534, the number of PVCs collected is 1,735,910, while the number of uncollected PVCs is 483,868. The uncollected PVCs have been deposited with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for safe keeping so that nobody can have access to them. INEC is going to be conducting elections in 2, 627 polling units in the 192 wards in Edo,” he said. Eyinla also explained that 14 political parties had presented candidates including 12 males and two females.He said that the commission had already deployed non-sensitive materials for the election while the sensitive materials would arrive the CBN two days to the election for deployment to local government areas and polling units. According to him, the commission will post election results on the viewing portal from various polling units. “It is not anything near what we call electronic transmission of results.

It is that same result pasted at the various polling units that INEC will upload to the portal for everybody to see”, he added. Eyinla urged the electorate to make good use of the portal, adding that it would help clear their doubts where necessary.
