He explained that the State Government had involved no fewer than forty NGOs and CBOs in the distribution drive. According to him, the organisations will be involved in both the transportation and the distribution of the items across the twenty one local governments of the state . ‘We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that all the vulnerable families are fully covered. While taking steps to ensure the efficient distribution of the items, the State Government hereby warns the beneficiaries against selling the palliatives. ‘We will also make sure any official found wanting in the discharge of his duty is properly sanctioned,’ he warned. According to the Governor, the items are meant to alleviate the hardships of the beneficiaries, to cushion the effect of the pandemic crisis. Bagudu had recently flagged-off the distribution of the palliatives to the 21 Local Governments Areas in the State.
