AMID reports that the Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) was preparing to remove what it believes to be 23,089 government ‘ghost’ pensioners from the Federal Government payroll, the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) has called on the agency to painstakingly ensure  the names are indeed ‘ghost’ pensioners. NUP, in a letter to PTAD, said the agency should also publish the names of the people in at least three national newspapers to create awareness both at home and abroad for pensioners involved. The union pleaded with the government agency not to take any hurried decision because the pensions are people’s sources of livelihood. The letter read in part: “Consequently, we would like to appreciate the painstaking efforts of PTAD in carrying out the last parastatals pensioners verification through the length and breadth of the country. The thoroughness and professionalism of your staff needed to be applauded and commended as well. “However, the union was shocked at the staggering figure of 23,089 pensioners about to be yanked off the payroll for various reasons. While we will not support continued payment of monthly pension to those pensioners who did not undergo verification, we are however of the firm belief that not all the entire twenty three thousand and eighty nine (23,089) pensioners on the attached list are dead, sick or even did not attend the aforesaid verification. It is glaringly impossible.
