The leaders of the women from the seven local governments took turn to air their minds in support of governor Obaseki. Addressing Journalists at the front gate of the House of Assembly, Edo South Senatorial Leader, Lady Uwa Osunbor said they have chosen to come out en-mass to throw their weight behind the incumbent governor in order to complete the projects he has already started.
