Turkish website, Fotospor has reported that Fenerbahce are looking to replace Vedat Muriqi by signing Leicester City attacker, Kelechi Iheanacho. The Super Lig side is reportedly in advanced talks with Lazio to sell Muriqi, and Fotospor claimed Iheanacho could be his replacement. Muriqi was linked with a move to the Foxes a few weeks ago but it seems he’s now destined to a transfer to Serie A. It’s reported Fenerbahce are ready to make a two-year loan offer to Leicester City for the Nigerian forward which could be worth as much as €12m. Iheanacho scored 10 goals for Leicester City in all competitions last season and was a regular member of Brendan Rodgers’ squad, making 26 appearances. However, the Turkish team hopes would be that he fancies being a nailed on starter elsewhere. The 23 year old had been linked with a move to Turkey before with the likes of Trabzonspor and Besiktas said to be interested. His contract with Leicester City will expire at the end of June 2023, so in the unlikely event they would agree to a two-year loan, they may also want to extend the player’s contract.
