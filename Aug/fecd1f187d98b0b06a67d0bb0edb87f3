Airtel Africa Plc and Mukuru, one of Africa’s largest remittance organisations, have announced a partnership that will enable Mukuru customers send cross-border transfers directly to Airtel Money customer wallets in 12 African countries. The partnership is expected to benefit customers making intra-Africa payments from Southern Africa where Mukuru has a leading presence. Customers also will no longer go to an agent to receive cross-border payments. Once Airtel Money customers receive the funds, they can be used to pay utility bills, goods and services, transferred to family or can be cashed out at any of Airtel Africa’s exclusive branches, kiosks and agents. Raghunath Mandava, CEO, Airtel Africa, commenting on the deal, said: “This partnership empowers those without a bank account to be included in the formal financial ecosystem and to move money conveniently, seamlessly and securely. At a time when intra-Africa cross-border payments are of strategic importance, we are pleased to be working together on cross-country mobile money transfers, while also supporting local economies.” Andy Jury, CEO, Mukuru, stated that the “partnership exemplifies the collaborative spirit in which Mukuru is engaging with other industry leaders to provide universal access to cash and digital financial services across the continent. The enablement of digital money transfers between Mukuru and Airtel Africa customers means we can offer greater choice to the hardworking diaspora when providing for their families back home. The freedom to choose the solution best befitting your personal circumstances is pivotal to true economic empowerment” The partnership, subject to local regulatory approvals, will initially launch in Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It will then roll out to subsequent Airtel Money markets.
