Enyimba coach, Fatai Osho said he’s aware Al Merrikh are a difficult team to beat, but confident the team will triumph. The two times CAF Champions League winners will slug it out with the Sudanese side in the first-leg of the final qualifying round of the competition today. Speaking ahead of the game, Osho described Al Merrikh as a dangerous opponent. “It won’t come easy, we’re quite aware of that. Al Merrikh – they are a very good side, a well-known team in Africa, just like Enyimba. “So, it’s going to be a very tough battle and we are quite aware of this and we’re really preparing towards it,” he said. Enyimba will be hoping to be second time lucky against a Sudanese opponent in the competition, after the were knocked out by Al Hilal at this same stage last year. In a related development, world football governing body, FIFA has banned Al Merreikh from signing new players. FIFA confirmed the ban in a statement released on their website after the Sudanese club was found guilty of owing ex-Brazilian player, Marcos de Santos Moraes unpaid wages.
