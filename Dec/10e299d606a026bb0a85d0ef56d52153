I keep vital people in my life with my brains! And anyone close to me will tell you that. My intelligence is my selling point. “The sexiest part of my body is my brain. When people get the chance to meet me and speak with me, they always end up falling for my brains,” she crooned. The curvy actress cum entrepreneur also hinted she wouldn’t mind undergoing liposuction in the future. “Yes I have plans for plastic surgery later in the future. As a mother who still wants more kids, yes I will do a few surgeries later but for now, I am enjoying my God giving natural body,” she concluded.
