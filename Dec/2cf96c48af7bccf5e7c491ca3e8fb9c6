From Ahmed Abubakar, Dutse Several youths in Jigawa were given sensitisation training by CHY Mall E-commerce Company, also known as Century Heng Yue Group Limited, on how to explore reliable online business spaces for job opportunities. CHY Mall E-commerce Company coordinator in charge of North East Aisha J Panguru said that they were in Jigawa to create awareness on the activities of the company due to the massive benefits attached to it. She said it is a fact that government alone cannot provide employment to all citizens of the country, hence the need to encourage people to become self-seeking entrepreneurs through reliable business opportunities within the cyberspace. Panguru, who said the CHY Mall E-commerce is a registered company which specialises in online business, also urged the people of the State to register with the company and own an online shop for them to earn profit within a short period of time. The North-East coordinator further disclosed that the programme which started one year ago will last for the next nine years, until 2029. Jigawa Coordinator of the company Engineer Ismaâ€™il Muhammad Gumel, who testified that he was one of the beneficiaries of the E-business, urged people to register with the company and earn more profit. CHY Mall E-commerce is an online market that allows you to own an online shop and start your business.
