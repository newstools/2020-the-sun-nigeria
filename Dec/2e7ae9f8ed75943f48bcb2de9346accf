The Golden Eaglets will begin the mandatory MRI age test this weekend just as officials disclosed that the team will soon begin playing test games. There are about 60 players in the team’s training camp in Abuja, who are lined up to undergo the age test. A first batch of 30 players will kick start the exercise. However, unlike previous such exercises only players with grades between 1 and 3 will be passed for the squad after CAF decided a failed age test by a player will cause the disqualification of the team. Officials also told SCORENigeria that the team will most likely begin playing friendly matches from tomorrow. “We will use the matches to fully assess the selected players,” a team official told SCORENigeria The Eaglets will feature in next month’s U17 AFCON in Benin. They are drawn in Group B along with Cote d’Ivoire and arch-rivals Ghana.
