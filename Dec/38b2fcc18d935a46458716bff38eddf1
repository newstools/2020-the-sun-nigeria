McDonald, who recently launched his 24-track album in 94 countries, gives vivid account of himself and reveals why rap chose him and not the other way round. “I did not choose rap, rap chose me. My music is just like my audio diary, it touches people all over the world, including people in Nigeria, Singapore, Australia, and it doesn’t matter the nationality,” he said.
