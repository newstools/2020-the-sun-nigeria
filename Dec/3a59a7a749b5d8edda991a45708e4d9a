the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has killer scores terrorists belonging to the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) and destroyed their hideouts at 1Km North of Tumbun Gini on the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State. Coordinator Defence Media Operations Major General John Enenche who made this known in a statement, said “In continuation of its sustained onslaught against insurgents operating in the North East of the Country, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has neutralized several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) elements and destroyed their hideouts at 1Km North of Tumbun Gini on the fringes of Lake Chad in Borno State. This was achieved through air strikes executed yesterday, 30 December 2020, after series of aerial surveillance missions had indicated that the location, with structures and logistics items camouflaged under the dense vegetation, was being used as staging area where some ISWAP leaders and their fighters meet to plan and launch attacks. “Accordingly, the ATF dispatched a force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the location in successive passes. The attack aircraft scored devastating hits in the target area, destroying some structures and neutralizing several of the ISWAP fighters while some survivors were seen fleeing the scene. Consequently, the fleeing ISWAP survivors were hit by second rockets and subsequently moped up.”
