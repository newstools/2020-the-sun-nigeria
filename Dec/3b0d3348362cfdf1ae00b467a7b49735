According to a statement from his management, D’Luxe Management run by Franklin Amudo, ever since the release of his latest single entitled Finally, which was released in early November featuring popular DJ Neptune and produced by P Loops, the new track has been topping charts. The statement read: “From Boomplay to iTunes, Finally, the newest single from Holmes to close the year has been creating a lot of buzz around town. The Amapiano inspired song is already being reviewed as a vibe to watch out for by industry heads as his career continues to soar after his major collaboration with Davido on the song, Love, earlier in the year.”
