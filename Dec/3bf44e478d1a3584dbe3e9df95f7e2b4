He further disclosed that Covid-19 pandemic affected businesses and lives which gave rise to high cases of claims demands on insurers, noting that “we at Anchor Insurance had our own fair share of the claims report, especially the Loss of Employment Insurance Scheme but we were equal to the task as the primary duty of any insurance company was to pay claims.” He thereafter appreciated the various customers who got smiles back on their faces for “considering us as the insurance company to come to when they needed their insurances,” assuring that “on our part, we will never relent in surpassing our customers’ expectations whenever duty calls on us.”
