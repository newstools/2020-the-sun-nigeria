The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Zamfara Chapter, has commended the state government for providing adequate security for Christians in the state during the Christmas celebration.  The State Chairman of the association, Rev. Fr. Iliya Tsiga, gave the commendation in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Gusau.  “We are particularly happy that in spite of the security challenges faced in the state, the peace and dialogue initiative of Gov. Bello Matawalle is working as it ensured a peaceful Christmas celebration in all nooks and crannies of the state.  “There was not a single case of security threat to any of our members both in towns and villages.  “All our members moved freely to and from churches as well as visiting friends, relations or other social activities to mark the event,” the clergy noted.  He said the Christian faithful had used the season to pray for continued peace in the state and God’s special intervention in improving the standard of living of Nigerians as well as continued brotherly relationship among all citizens.  Rev. Tsiga urged the people in the state and the country in general to observe COVID-19 protocols as directed by experts and governments.  Tsiga also prayed to God to terminate all challenges facing the country by the end of the year.  “With the passage of a realistic budget in the state, l am confident that the state governor and government will have the zeal and strength towards a better state,” he said.  He further commended Gov. Matawalle for giving Christians N5 million, 600 bags of rice and 20 cows as donations to ensure smooth and happy celebration.  “We are really happy for this kind of brotherly gesture given to us by Gov. Matawalle which we shared among our members,” he said. (NAN)
