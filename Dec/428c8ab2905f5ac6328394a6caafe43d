(From Desmond Mgboh, Kano) The Caretaker Committee Chairman, People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Kano State, Danladi Abduhamid Kagari has accused Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of sponsoring a tiny group within the PDP as part of his design to undermine the resurgence of the opposition party in the State. Speaking with Daily Sun following a faction of the party’s insistence on participating in the January 16th Local Government Polls, Kagari stressed that the said faction was sponsored by the government to make the contrary statement, hinting that the government needed to give credibility to the January polls. ‘The faction, although very insignificant in number, is working very hard to assist the All Progressives Congress(APC) kill the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in the State,’ he stated. ‘I can tell you that the son of the so-called leader of the purported faction is an executive member of the APC in the State. So what else would they not do?’ Kagari explained that after a discrete investigation, the PDP in the State arrived at the conclusion that Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC) has no capacity to conduct a truly independent and credible election come January. ‘If you bother to ask some of the members of the APC in the State, they would also tell you that the way their candidates were picked from above has nothing to do with democracy, that certain candidates have been preset to win the polls,’ he further explained. He maintained that the economy was very challenging adding that it would be most unfair to allow their beloved party members go ahead and procure forms to contest an election where they would never be announced as winners of the exercise. He held that the mission of his seven-member Caretaker Committee was to strive towards the growth of the party in the State adding that they have already commenced engagements with various stakeholders towards ensuring the best for the party in the State.
