Speaking with newsmen at the scene of the attack, the Governor condemned the barbaric act saying only a few weeks ago, the herders came without cattle and killed a husband and wife at Tse-Tyohemba, in the same axis of Makurdi. The Governor who commended the efforts of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS) and other security agencies explained that security operatives were able to trail and apprehended three of the assailants in the former attack. Ortom however assured the people that security had been beefed up to ensure 24 hours vigilance in the affected area to prevent a re-occurence of the ugly development and urged people of the affected communities to cooperate with security operatives. The Governor who also addressed the people at Adaka said enforcement of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law of the state must continue no matter what armed the opposition from herders.
