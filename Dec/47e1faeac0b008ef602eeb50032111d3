Stories by Chinelo Obogo The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has assured that the new international terminal at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos, currently being constructed by the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) would be commissioned next February. The Managing Director of FAAN Rabiu Yadudu, stated this when the House Committee on Aviation visited the agency’s facilities at the Lagos Airport as part of its oversight functions. According to him, the terminal (which is  one of the four in which construction began in 2013 and was to be completed in 24 months) would have been completed this December but for the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The Chinese company had sourced about $500 million for the construction of the four new terminals in Lagos, Port Harcourt, Kano and Abuja with counterpart funding of $100 million from the Federal Government. While some of the terminals had since been commissioned and currently used by airlines and passengers, the Lagos terminal was hampered due to some gaps noticed in the system, which had since been closed. Yadudu also said that FAAN’s management has since taken some critical steps to improve revenue generation and curb spending in recent months, assuring that the agency would continue in that stead. Some of these steps include the suspension of procurement of non- essential items, reduction in all staff related cost to the barest minimum and aggressive debt recovery drive, which he said was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
