Some civil society organisations have urged the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to prioritise electoral reforms in his second term especially ahead of the 2023 general elections. The CSOs known as Raising New Voices and Centre for Liberty, stated this in a joint congratulatory letter to Yakubu on his confirmation for another term. The letter, signed by Messrs Jude Feranmi and Ariyo-Dare Atoye was made available to newsmen on Sunday in Abuja. They urged Yakubu to “continue to prevail on the National Assembly to ensure the Electoral Bill was passed before February 2020”. Yakubu was re-nominated for a second term by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 9 and confirmed by the Senate on December 3. The CSOs urged the INEC boss to use his commitment to reforms and technology-driven process to further improve on Nigeria’s electoral process. They expressed satisfaction with the confirmation of Yakubu’s re-appointment, saying there had been improvements in the recent elections conducted by the commission. The CSOs commended the achievements of Yakubu in his first tenure, advising him to build on the successes recorded in the recent Edo and Ondo governorship elections in future elections. “Indeed, your re-nomination by President Muhammadu Buhari is a testament to your noble accomplishments and transformational leadership at INEC. “Your commitment to electoral reform, electoral integrity and the transformation of INEC into technology-driven institution is remarkable and should be commended beyond partisan considerations.
