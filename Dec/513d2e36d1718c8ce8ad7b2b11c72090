By EMMA JEMEGAH The chairman of the Delta State Football Association, Edema Fuludu, has said that he was waiting for further action by FIFA over the current imbroglio that has enveloped football in the state. Fuludu said at the weekend that the recent letter of FIFA to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) was an indication that something positive will happen soon on the ongoing crisis. FIFA, only recently wrote a letter to the NFF over the Delta FA elections won by Edema Fuludu as chairman and Victor Ikpeba as vice chairman respectively. The world football body demanded for answers over alleged interference from Abuja on the affairs of the body in Asaba. “They kept that letter and I learnt they are trying to reply secretly,” a source said. The Delta FA sent two separate letters with documents on NFF’s Statutes, Delta FA Statutes and State FA laws. It could be recalled that the NFF earlier in the year set up a normalization committee that conducted an election that brought in another factional chairman, Kenneth Nwaomucha. Fuludu also said that he had written the NFF to send the FIFA palliatives, which is a COVID-19 relief grant, to his team and no other person. “What they are doing all along are attempts to legalise illegalities. The palliatives should come to us and not an illegal body,” Fuludu said.
