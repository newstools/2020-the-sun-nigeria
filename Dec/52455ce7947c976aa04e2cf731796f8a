Rohr, in a goodwill message to the NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, who turned 50 recently pointed out that he had worked with the federation for some years and have enjoyed his support all through. “Happy birthday, president, it’s four and half years that we are together, and I hope that when it’s your birthday in December, you didn’t sack me yet (laugh),” Rohr said in a video shared on the Super Eagles Twitter handle. “I hope that we go further and win this AFCON and possibly the World Cup together, he stated” The former Delta State FA Chairman and the German tactician have being working together since the former Gabon head coach was named the Super Eagles Technical Adviser in 2016.
