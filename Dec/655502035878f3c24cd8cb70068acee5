God knows what is right for me; he can’t give what will cost me my joy. When I was deep with things of God, there was no year that I didn’t get job adverts here and there. But I misused the grace, I lived a life that is not mine and there is nothing fruitful I can tag to it. I have not been in a relationship with a single guy for years due to what I have experienced.

When the time is right, God will bless me with a perfect suitor; He knows what’s right for me.”
