The Rotary club of Lagos has promised to partner the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), to sustain businesses. To foster  this relationship, to the benefit of SMEs and Nigeria, President of the Club,   Dare Ayodele, said  since the LCCI stands for Connecting Businesses Creating Value and Rotary club is about creating value for the society through good works    by business  people and leaders who came together, there is a synergy for a collaborative value. Noting that business cannot thrive at the expense of the society  and the environment, he pointed out that by collaboration with LCCi,  “we can ensure that business  is done in a way that benefits humanity and the environment. To foster that by collaboration, he said the club will ensure there is  peace,  because  business  cannot thrive in an envelope of chaos. “we live in a world characterised by conflicts,  tension,  we need to bring peace because   business  can only happen in an environment  of peace,  so the first we do is in the area of promoting  peace. He also added that it is only the healthy that can run a business “When people  are sick they can’t  run business. We fight diseases by preventing and by treatment. Also water is essential in this period of COVID. “So we try to provide  water.” He emphasised  that  the clubs support for education will provide competence  and skills  to do business. Directly  it has been and will continue to empower businesses  by giving loans to SMEs. “As we do business,  the environment  is polluted,  so we support the environment by tree planting, clearing of waterways,  ensuring that we use energy sustainably.. All of these are ways of collaborating with the chamber because  that makes the business environment  conducive. For her part, President of the LCCI, Toki Mabogunje, noted that Rotary is passionate about micro enterprises.
