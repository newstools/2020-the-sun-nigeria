By Paul Erewuba Former British lightweight boxer, Peter Oboh, has backed Anthony Joshua to defeat Kubrat Pulev in their world heavyweight title fight, as the Nigerian defends his titles against the Bulgarian at the SSE Arena in Wembley tomorrow night. However, Oboh, former Commonwealth lightweight boxing champion, has pleaded with Joshua not to be complacent when both boxers meet. Joshua had told Sky Sports that he is mentally prepared for an explosive encounter with his Bulgarian opponent, who has only suffered just one defeat against Wladimir Klitschko in 2014.
