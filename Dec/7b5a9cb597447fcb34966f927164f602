From John Adams, Minna The National Examinations Council (NECO) says it has launched a full-scale investigation into alleged examination malpractice in one its examinations centres at the Fabian Kings and Queens International School, Kabala West, Kaduna, Kaduna State, in the just concluded Senior School Certificates Examinations (SSCE). The examinations centre was reported to have been involved in some infractions during the just concluded 2020 SSCE (Internal). NECO, in a statement in Minna on Monday, signed by the head Information Unit, Mallam Azeez Sani, said that based on the Council’s zero tolerance for examination malpractice, ‘it swung swiftly into action by flagging the centre, identifying and isolating all the candidates’ scripts for scrutiny.’ Sani said that the Council had constituted an Administrative Committee to investigate the allegation in order to enable the Council to take appropriate actions. He assured that ‘if found culpable, the entire results of the candidates will be cancelled, the school will be derecognised and those examination officials involved in the act will be prosecuted in accordance with the Examination Malpractice Decree 33 of 1999.’ Sani disclosed that the attention of the council was drawn to these infractions online on Wednesday, December 2, by a media outlet, which alerted the body. While commending the authorities of Signature Television for their interest in ensuring the sanctity of public examinations, Sani vowed that the NECO will stop at nothing to unravel the circumstances that led to these infractions.
