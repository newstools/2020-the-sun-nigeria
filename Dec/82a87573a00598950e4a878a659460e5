He explained that peace could only be achieved  when all the zones are given equal opportunities,that unity is crucial for advancement. He said “The agitation that I lead is the collective anger or the pains in the minds of so many minorities in Nigeria.if the minority voices are not heard then there will be no peace, equity and justice in a nation .If these exited then there will be peace  and progress for any nation. ” In an environment where the minorities are short out of prominence,they would struggle through many means to emerge. If you practice oppression how do you think those manorities will give you support when you are in need of it. He further disagreed with the notion that the minorities would punish the majorities ,if given opportunities, saying that politics is a game of number. He stated that the right thing should be done which is the relinquishment of political powers among all the zones.
