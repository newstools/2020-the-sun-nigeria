By Charles Nwaguji and Merit Ibe The Small and Medium Enterprises  Development Agency (SMEDAN) has urged all Micro Small Medium Enterprises(MSMEs) to register online to benefit from government’s funds and grants. Assistant Director at  SMEDAN, Gloria Nwakamma, who gave the advice at the ongoing  Lagos International Trade Fair,  said since the agency is part of the organisers and management of the registration, it was then needful to create the awareness at the fair for business  owners.  She said no matter the nature of the business  or trade, everyone is encouraged to go online, register with a government  agency and then generate a certificate  with a pin code, which can be used when needed to access funds from the government. “MSMEs that can benefit  from government funds and grants are those who have registered with government agencies. SMEDAN is part of the organisers and management of the. Whatever business you are doing,  just go online and register,  you will generate a certificate with a pin code you will keep for further use.” Nwakamma, who disclosed that the association came with about 10 SMEs which  it sponsored to the fair to display their wares, said SMEDAN is a one stop shop for SMEs,  as its duty  is to see  to the growth of small businesses. “When events like this come up, we see  more of the micro small and medium enterprises.  We are in the age of technology and innovations, so when people come to fairs like this,  they go back  and improve on their businesses. “We expect  that something  new everyday  based on the demand of the people, situation  of the economy and others. She said the agency was at the fair  to give information, counseling, advice, linkages. “We don’t have anything physical to give our customers. At the end of the Fair  we expect every participant, both consumers  and producers, buyers and sellers,  or visitors to go home happy over products bought or sold.”
