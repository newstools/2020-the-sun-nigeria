Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa has expressed concern about a confirmed attack on Garkida town in Gombi Local Government Area of the state. Eyewitness report indicated that the attack  was carried out by  suspected Boko Haram insurgents on Dec. 24. Fintiri, in a statement on Friday in Yola,  said that the attack caused the death of two civilians, including a five-year old. “This latest cowardly attack on Garkida town is yet another desperate rear guard action by the Boko Haram terrorists who have been under intense pressure from the Nigerian military. Let me reassure Adamawa residents  that this latest cowardly attack on Garkida would not go without severe consequences,” Fintiri said. The governor, however,  sympathised  with residents of Garkida over the unfortunate attack and called  on security agencies to do more to further forestall attacks in the state. Fintiri noted that it was  a  cruel reminder of the indiscriminate aims of the terrorists and an example of why everyone must be involved to confront a menace without boundaries. “I stand with Garkida community in this difficult time, and will continue to support the military  efforts to ensure peace, security and justice for our people,” Fintiri said. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, confirmed the attack but refused to make further comment.
