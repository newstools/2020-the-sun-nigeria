Though the number of runners that will participate at the 2021 Lagos City Marathon has been pegged at 10,000 instead of the over 100,000 that normally grace Africa’s biggest one-day event due to Covid-19, the event is still attracting much buzz. Equally, despite the 10,000km race been suspended for this edition and the cream de la cream of global entertainers may not grace the finish point at the luxurious Eko Atlantic City in large numbers, the 2021 edition of the Lagos race may turn out to be the best in the series and even earn the race the prestigious World Athletics Gold Label. In a statement signed by Olukayode Thomas, Head Communications and Media, he said the race General Manager, Yussuf Alli has signed quality elite runners for the 2021 race. According to World Athletics regulations, top races in the world must draw their elite field from the top 300 runners in the world who are gold, silver, and bronze label runners. For the 2021 Lagos City Marathon, Thomas revealed that Alli has signed on only gold label runners. “A lot of runners from different parts of the world are showing interest in our race but for the 2021 edition any male runner that has not run inside 2hrs.10 mins will not be part of our elite field. As of today, the only male runners that I have shortlisted for the 2021 race are 2hrs.04 mins runners, 2hrs.05mins, and 2hrs.”
