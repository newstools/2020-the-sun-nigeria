From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Minister of Interior Mr Rauf Aregbesola has declared that he holds no grudge against the Ondo State Governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, despite the political differences between them in the wake of the 2016 governorship election in Ondo State. Aregbesola, speaking in Akure on Monday at the commissioning of fire fighting vehicles in the State, noted that the past differences between himself and the Governor have become a thing of the past. The Minister, who was a former Governor of Osun State, allegedly sponsored Olusola Oke against Akeredolu during the 2016 gubernatorial election in the State. While Akeredolu contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Oke, believed to be sponsored by Aregbesola, contested under the Alliance for Democracy (AD). The Minister said his personal presence to commission the fire fighting vehicles was to further assure Governor Akeredolu that whatever that happened between them before has been buried in the past. Aregbesola, recalling that Akeredolu was his personal lawyer before his emergence as Governor of Osun State in 2010, said that Ondo is his home, having spent the first eighteen years of his life in the State. Commissioning the fire fighting vehicles, Aregbesola urged the people to be careful with the use of power generating equipment. He also urged them to be committed to preventing fire incidents, adding that it was more reasonable and safe to prevent fire incidents than to contain them.
