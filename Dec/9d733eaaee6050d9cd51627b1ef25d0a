From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has described as insensitive and callous the call by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Caucus in the House of Representatives for the impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari over the escalating insecurity in the country. In a statement issued by the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, the ruling party maintained that President Buhari is perfectly on the same page with the National Assembly in the fight against insecurity. The APC said in the statement it has ‘no intention of joining issues with a crass statement credited to Chinda, a purported factional “leader” of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives in which he has resorted to denigrate the office and person of the President by name-calling and insults. ‘[Kingsley] Chinda’s insensitive and callous intention is to play politics with the grief of citizens in the aftermath of the recent, gruesome and condemnable killings of some defenceless farmers in Zabarmari, Borno state by Boko Haram. The APC will not join Chinda and his PDP backers on this evil and ignoble road. ‘We have since learnt that Chinda does not even have the support of any of the PDP House factions he claims to head. He is a lone, rejected voice. The House of Representatives has already dismissed Chinda’s rant as illogical, self-serving and a ploy to derail the proposed visit of the President to the House. ‘The leadership of the National Assembly, the President and Armed Forces which the president heads as Commander in chief are on the same page in tackling emerging security situations in the country and ensure the safety of all Nigerians.’
