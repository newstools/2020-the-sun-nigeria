Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti has explained the rationale behind his choice of Alex Iwobi for the left wing-back position during his side’s 1-0 loss to Leeds United in their last Premier League outing at Goodison Park. The move by the experienced Italian football tactician saw summer signing Niels Nkounkou, who is a natural left-back, miss out on the matchday 18. Against Leeds United, Everton played with two makeshift wing-backs, Tom Davies being the other, as a result of the injuries suffered by Lucas Digne and Seamus Coleman. Nkounkou was expected by many to step into Lucas Digne’s shoes but in a surprise move, Ancelotti preferred the attack-minded Iwobi, who shone playing as a right wing-back vs Fulham in the previous game. Speaking to reporters at Friday’s press conference before the trip to Burnley, Ancelotti explained: “Nkounkou was not in the squad because I have 11 players, I decided to put Iwobi on the left. The squad is really big. “He’s still young, he needs more experience, he needs to work more. But I am honestly satisfied for what he is doing. “He will have time in the next game because we have a lot of games. “The fact we played with two midfielders [as wing backs], I think we have good cover because usually the two midfielders have the help of one of the centre-backs to cover the position behind them.” Nkounkou has made only one Premier League appearance since joining Everton from Marseille in July 2020.
