Medical staff from the Nigeria squad tried to pop it back into place on the field, then he returned to Italy for tests and a specialist consultation. Now Tuttosport claim that the shoulder dislocation has fully recovered, but Osimhen still can’t lift his arm properly.

The former Lille of France hitman denied Tuttosport claims that the Nigerian medics made his shoulder injury worse. Osimhen chose to respond directly by quote-tweeting the Football Italia coverage of that Tuttosport report.
