(Al Jazeera) A strong earthquake has hit central Croatia, with injuries reported as well as considerable damage to buildings southeast of the capital. The earthquake was felt throughout the country on Tuesday, as well as in neighbouring Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The European Mediterranean Seismological Center said a magnitude earthquake hit 46km (17 miles) southeast of Zagreb. Initial reports said the earthquake caused wide damage, collapsing roofs, building facades and even some entire buildings. The same area was struck by a 5.2 quake on Monday. Buildings collapsed in Petrinja, some 60km (37 miles) from Zagreb. An Al Jazeera reporter in the town witnessed a child and their father being pulled from a car buried in the rubble.
Croatian Red Cross said it was responding to a “very serious” situation in Petrinja following the earthquake. Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at Imperial College in London, tweeted: “We can probably expect quite strong shaking and hence some damage to buildings from this earthquake.” Slovenia’s Krsko nuclear power plant was been shut down as a precaution, the plant’s spokeswoman said Tuesday. “I can confirm the preventive shutdown,” spokeswoman Ida Novak Jerele told AFP.
