An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr Yusuf Abdullahi, said in Ilorin on Friday that Nigerians should support orphanages and make life more meaningful for the children kept in those homes. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that orphanages across the country should not suffer neglect. “Governments at all levels need to do more to support orphanages. NGOs and individuals must also support by way of donation of foodstuffs, and other day-to-day needs of orphans. “Religious organisations are not left out; they should also support orphanages in whichever way they can. “It is everybody’s responsibility to support orphans and orphanages and it is an obligation that should not be left to governments alone. “Most orphanages today suffer neglect and the orphans kept in such homes are at the receiving end of the seeming abandonment,’’ he said. Abdullahi also called on governments to ensure that every child acquired one skill or another to become self-employed and independent in the future. (NAN)
