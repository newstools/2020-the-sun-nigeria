From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri An Owerri high court has asked that the status quo be maintained in the motion filed by Alloy Ejimakor, counsel to former Governor of Imo State Ikedi Ohakim on contempt of committal proceedings seeking to imprison the respondents which include the Commissioner of Police, Ms Chinyere Amuchienwa, lawyers and others on the matter. The police prosecutor and counsel to Amuchienwa, MO Omosun, told the court that he had earlier served a preliminary objection on the motion for the committal proceedings on the applicantâ€™s lawyer. However, counsel to the applicants denied receiving the objection notice from the respondents, insisting that he was just served a few minutes before the court sitting. He urged the court to quash the matter, claiming that the objection was misconceived. But ruling on the matter, the presiding judge, GO Chukwuyenre, asked both parties to retain status quo pending the hearing of the application on January 28, 2021.
