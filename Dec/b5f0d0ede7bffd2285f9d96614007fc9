From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja Nigeria’s galloping inflation which was triggered by COVID-19 pandemic, rising insecurity, and food price continued its upward swing in November perching at  14.89 per cent (year-on-year). The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in a statement yesterday, said the latest inflation figure  represents 0.66 percentage points higher than the rate recorded in October 2020 (14.23 per cent).

However, a capital market professor and former Commissioner of Information, Imo State, Uche Uwaleke, observed  that the  rise in headline inflation by 14.89 per cent in November from 14.23 per cent in October in spite of the drop in core inflation over the same period clearly shows that the major challenge remains rising cost of food as food inflation jumped from 17.38 per cent in October to 18.30 per cent in November. “The NBS inflation numbers for the month of November is a reflection of the lingering impact of COVID’19 as well as legacy issues of insecurity in many parts of the country, border closure, increase  in VAT,  pump price  of fuel, electricity tariffs and exchange rates.
