By Merit Ibe Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industries (NASSI) has emphasised  the need to improve and expand members’ capacity in preparation  for the AFCFTA which kicks off in January. Lagos Chairman of the Association,  Gertrude Akhimien, made the remark at the 4th Lagos NASSI, Micro, Small and  Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)  trade fair with the theme:  AfCFTA: Taking African Trade by the Storm,  where she noted that it was important for Nigeria in particular to get to the  African market with enough quality  products,  capacity and without fear.  To take AfCFTA  by storm, Akhimien said  government needs to grow the MSMEs sector by identifying small businesses already growing,  expand them by funding, equip them with  machines, with more workers and see them produce massively.  “It is only massive production that can take AFCFTA by storm. We need to go into the market with large quantity  of our quality products. “The association needs to prepare  businesses and members to get their products ready for export. If we don’t do that,  our country will become a dumping ground for other countries. “We need to get ready by improving  and expanding capacity so that we can go to the African market without fear, with good products,  capacity and enough products. She noted that the place of small businesses  cannot be over emphasised, saying during the lock down,  “MSMEs affected  our economy, they produced and supplied goods to homes for survival despite the pandemic. “MSMEs  sustained the local economy,  without  a local economy we cannot  survive.”
