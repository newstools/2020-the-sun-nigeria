The Emede people are blaming their Igbide counterparts for the missing persons, alleging that the Igbide people were responsible for mayhem last week in which about five persons lost their lives while properties worth millions of naira were destroyed. The two communities have been at each otherâ€™s jugular over the years as a result of boundary dispute. Raising the alarm over the alleged missing persons in a statement, the chairman of Emede Progressive Union, Abuja branch, Omrys Ofo, condemned the latest outbreak of violence.
