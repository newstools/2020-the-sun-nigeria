By Tosin Akinola The president of Theater and Movie Producers Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN), Bolaji Amusan popularly known as Mr. Latin, has commended the association for being part of positive changes the industry recorded over the years.
He made the commendation at the first TAMPAN Academic Conference, which held at Marve 21, Ring Road, Ibadan, Oyo State on December 15, 2020. “The Nigerian film industry has experienced a lot of metamorphosis in both artistic, visual and technology. For better production value, we embraced the innovation of higher resolution camera with fantastic dynamic range. This shows that TAMPAN is an eclectic association of various experts in filmmaking,” he said.
