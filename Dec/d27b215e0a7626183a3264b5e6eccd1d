From Godwin Tsa, Abuja Abuja division of the Federal High Court has reserved ruling in a motion filed by Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, seeking to stop further hearing in the certificate forgery suit brought against him by the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed, yesterday, shortly after taking arguments from lawyers representing APC, Akin Olujimi and the governor’s counsel, Ken Mozia, said ruling on the motion will be delivered on December 15. Governor Obaseki had applied to the court to adjourn indefinitely, further proceedings in the certificate forgery suit against him on the grounds that he had filed an appeal at the Abuja division of the Court of Appeal challenging the refusal of Justice Mohammed to expunge some paragraphs in the APC’s reply to his affidavit. While moving a motion for stay of further proceedings, Mozia told the court that the records of proceedings have been transmitted to the Court of Appeal and that the notice of appeal has been entered at the appellate court with appeal number CA/ABJ/CV/1072/2020. The senior lawyer canvassed that since the decision of the High Court refusing to expunge some paragraphs in APC’s reply is being challenged, it is a law for the lower court to hands off from the matter pending the outcome of the appellate court’s decision. However, Olujimi, who argued for APC, urged the court to dismiss the motion for indefinite adjournment of the certificate forgery suit on the grounds that it was a pre-election matter and was bound by time. Olujimi contended that since the case had a life span of 180 days which would terminate by January 9, 2021, it was in the interest of justice for the court to continue with proceedings.
