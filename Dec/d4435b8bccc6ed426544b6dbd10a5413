From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti The Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, has congratulated the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Ojaja II, on his fifth coronation anniversary. The Governor said the foremost traditional ruler has been making very significant impact in the development of Yoruba land in particular and Nigeria in general since his ascension to the exalted throne. Fayemi, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, hailed the Ooni for using his position to promote peace among the various ethnic nationalities in the country as well as working with relevant stakeholders and institutions to advance the socio- economic development of the people. Describing Ooni Ogunwusi as a vibrant, visionary and progressive monarch, the Governor noted that the Arole Oodua has always been in the forefront of the quest for a just society where there is justice, equity and fairness. The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) who described the Ooni as a ” Peace Ambassador” and a ” Bridge Builder”, said the royal father has always lent his voice to the unity and indivisibility of the Nigerian federation and his counsel has always helped to calm frayed nerves at critical points in the country. He said Ooni has used his God-given wisdom, diplomacy, tact and humility to contribute to the peaceful resolution of some knotty issues in the country to the admiration of all. Fayemi also commended the Ooni for his interest in the youths, especially in the area of project sponsorship and provision of platforms for them to showcase their God-given talents, a development that has taken many youths off the streets and given them opportunity to positively contribute to nation building. He prayed God to grant the Ooni long life, good health and peaceful and purposeful reign to continue to contribute meaningfully to national development, unity and harmony in the country. ” On behalf of my wife, the Government and good people of Ekiti State, I congratulate our amiable royal father, Ooni Ogunwusi, and pray that peace, progress and prosperity continue to be the hallmark of his reign” The Governor added.
