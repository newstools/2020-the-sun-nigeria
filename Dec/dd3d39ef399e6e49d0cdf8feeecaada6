From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the Presidency’s response to the Financial Times editorial on the state of the country confirmed leadership failure in Nigeria. The PDP in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan said it was sad the Presidency preferred to rebuff “wise counsel” rather than seek help for the country. The opposition party noted that the Financial Times editorial merely stated the obvious as the country under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government has presented all the trappings of a failed state. “Indeed, the editorial by Financial Times is only stating the obvious, as our nation under President Buhari has presented all the trappings of a failed state including having a rudderless government with a dysfunctional command structure that cannot guarantee security, manage our economy or even perform very simple tasks of governance. “Our great nation now tends towards a leaderless society where terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, marauders and vandals have taken the lead, running riotous across our land while those who promised to protect lives and property have gone into hiding in Aso Presidential Villa. “Under President Buhari, life is fast tilting towards Hobbesian state of  nature; driven by the combined negatives of an incompetent and unconcerned Presidency and a reckless, kleptomaniac and dysfunctional ruling party that is more interested in power-grabbing instead of governance. “President Buhari has badly failed in governance to the extent that over 600 students could be kidnapped by bandits in his home state, Katsina, a few hours after his security machinery took over the state, where he had gone to holiday. “Under Buhari’s watch, our command structure has become extremely weak that government officials now patronize bandits and rationalize acts of terrorism to the extent of blaming victims for not obtaining permission before living their normal lives as was the case in the 43 farmers beheaded by terrorists in Borno state. “Under this failed administration, outlaws who had been pushed to the fringes by previous administration have resurged and taken control of some parts of our nation where they reportedly have to give their consent to residents before they can conduct weddings, naming ceremonies or operate their markets.”
