From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti Ekiti State Government has charged residents on safety and security consciousness, and to embrace measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 particularly at the festive period. The State Commissioner for Information and Values Orientation, Hon. Akin Omole who gave the advice on Thursday in Ado- Ekiti, stressed the importance of strict adherence to laid down protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the State. Omole described Christmas as” a season of love and peaceful co-existence when people should extend hand of care and kindness.” He added that” the period commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, who is the symbol of Christianity and should therefore be used to pray for the State while following the footsteps of Christ.” Reiterating the commitment of the Fayemi-led administration to the general wellbeing of people in the State, Omole assured that the State Government would leave no stone unturned to guarantee the safety of lives and property of the people. According to him,” the peculiarity of the year occasioned by the global pandemic and the recent spike in cases of the virus in several countries have resulted in a call for low-key celebrations.’ He stressed that it would be unreasonable for anyone to flout government directives aimed at preventing avoidable spread of the virus. He, therefore, called for the continued support of all stakeholders for the efforts of government to develop the State and make life more meaningful for the people.
