From Jude Chinedu, Enugu Enugu State Football Association, on Thursday, ratified Chief Tony Ugwu as its substantive chairman following the demise of late Chief Offor Okenwa in early May. Chief Ugwu who has been in acting capacity since then was unanimously confirmed as the new chairman during an extraordinary congress of the football association in Enugu.

In his acceptance speech, Chief Ugwu solicited the help of football stakeholders in his bid to take the game to greater heights, stating that late Chief Okenwaâ€™s achievements were too enormous for him to attain alone.
