(Reuters/NAN) World boxing heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua knocked out Bulgarian Kubrat Pulev near the end of the ninth round on Saturday to retain his IBF, WBO and WBA belts. The 31-year-old Nigerian-born Briton was close to winning when he floored Pulev in the third round after a sweet right hand at the Wembley Arena in London. But the challenger recovered to test the home favourite in front of a limited crowd of 1,000. Pulev, 39, remained dangerous, without causing Joshua many anxious moments, but there was no escape in the ninth round. Joshua landed a clubbing right uppercut which sent Pulev to the canvas. The Bulgarian got back to his feet but Joshua connected with another huge right hand to end the contest.
