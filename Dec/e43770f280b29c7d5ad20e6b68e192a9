From Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin Unknown gunmen yesterday evening kidnapped the Edo State Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa along Oza Road, in Orhiomwon Local Government Area of the state. The gunmen, it was gathered, killed his official driver, whose name could not be immediately confirmed, before abducting Mr Okungbowa. A senior civil servant, who pleaded anonymity, said the incident happened after attend- ing a local event in Oza. “He was kidnapped on his way back to Benin City after attending a local event in Oza. His driver was killed,” he said. However, effort to confirm the incident from the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, proved abortive as he did not pick up his phone calls. The state Commissioner of Police, Johnson Babatunde Kokumo, also did not pick up several calls to his phone.
