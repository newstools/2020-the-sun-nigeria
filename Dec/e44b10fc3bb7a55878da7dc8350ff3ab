As part of its commitment to help build resilience for businesses in a post-COVID economy, MTN Nigeria has revealed plans to launch new mobile applications relevant to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Chief Enterprise Business Officer of the Company, Lynda Saint-Nwafor disclosed this at Y’ello Clinic, an engagement session between MTN Executives and business owners. Speaking to participants, she said, “Your feedback through these sessions help us serve you better. We now understand that ICT applications are a great need in most of our businesses as they help provide easier ways to manage customers. With that, we are birthing a set of Customer Relations Management (CRM) applications made specifically for Nigerian SMEs. We are also developing a platform that will serve as a marketplace for all MSME ICT needs. Our extensive ecosystem will be made available to work for you as we provide software applications for SMEs. My team and I are already working with our regulator to make this happen”, she added. The Y’ello Clinic, an offshoot of the Revv Program featured MTN Nigeria Executives including Chief Operating Officer, Mazen Mroue; Chief Financial Officer, Modupe Kadri; Chief Sales & Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi; Chief Corporate Services Officer, Tobechukwu Okigbo; Chief Transformation Officer, Olubayo Adekanmbi; and Chief Human Resources Officer, Esther Akinnukawe. Lynda shared that the ICT leader is aware of SMEs contributions to Nigeria’s GDP. As a result, “We are continuously exploring opportunities to build capacity within this segment. The Revv Program is an expression of our commitment to this segment. We have had nine masterclasses so far and I believe these sessions have provided new ideas on managing and scaling businesses.” The Revv Program was created to help business owners rethink and retool their operations to withstand the impact of the pandemic.
