I believe that by the grace of God the sky wouldn’t be my limit. I heard about the 100 Percent Entertainment reality TV show on Instagram and I applied. Bingo! I was called up. At first, I was tense but along the line I became more confident. I wish to dedicate my success to my family and all my fans that stood by me. Above all, I want to dedicate my crown to God Almighty for his abundant grace upon my life. The feeling of success cannot be described. I was overwhelmed!” Reacting, founder and organiser of the show, Ken Bassey described MOG as a “super-talented artiste who gave his best during the contest”, adding that his platform, Dabinchi Global will do all within its capacity to take his career to the next level.
