Super Eagles keeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa was simply on cloud nine when his club, Heartland stormed Ikenne, Ogun state where they played out a goalless draw against Remo Stars in a pre season friendly on Wednesday. Ezenwa was thrilled beyond words by the hybrid geotech turf at the Ikenne home of Remo Stars constructed by Nigeria’s leading stadium construction outfit, Monimichelle. Ezenwa after the game said the pitch is simply world class, even as he urged NPFL clubs and the various state governments to partner Monimichelle as a way of getting the state of the art pitch at all league venues across the country. “If we have this kind of pitch at all the league venues, fans would see the best of football. What we have here in Ikene is the same with what the same company constructed in Aba. I played for Enyimba and I know the Enyimba stadium in Aba boasts of one best pitch in the country. I want to see this kind of pitch in Owerri and I would plead that other states should partner with Monimichelle. He is doing a damn good job.”
