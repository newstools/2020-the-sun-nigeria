From Tony John, Port Harcourt The Chairman of Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State, Mr Samuel Nwanosike, has denied allegations that he borrowed over N1 billion from a bank to executive projects in the council. Nwanosike made the denial Monday when he appeared on a live radio programme in Port Harcourt, describing the allegation as baseless and unfounded. ‘It is a big lie that I borrowed over a billion naira. Which bank will give me, a Local Government chairman, such money? What would be the equity or, what would be my paper plan to borrow a billion naira?,’ asked the council boss. He urged members of the public to discountenance the claims, stressing that it was false. The Ikwerre council chairman challenged youths to participate actively in politics and not stand aloof waiting for government. Nwanosike, who was a former Publicity Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in Rivers, urged Nigerian youths to participate in politics and also obtain their voter’s card as scheduled next year by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). ‘We are asking that, why sit back on election day playing football, organising parties instead of participating actively in politics to bring positive changes in the story. ‘We want you people to see that INEC has called for registration in the first quarter of next year. Please, take advantage of it. Go and get your voter’s card,’ he urged.
