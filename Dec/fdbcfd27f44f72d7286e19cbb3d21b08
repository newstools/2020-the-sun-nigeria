MTN Nigeria is set to launch ‘Zigi,’ an online assistant chatbot designed to enhance customers’ digital interactions with the brand, and provide speedy and secure marketing, sales and technical support. Customers will be able to interact with the chatbot on multiple channels including WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, the official MTN website and myMTN App. It will provide a wide range of services including account balance checks, airtime, data purchases and answers to frequently asked questions. The chatbot will also have the ability to transfer customers to a live agent. These channels and varying features will be rolled out in phases as ‘Zigi’ continues to evolve to offer comprehensive support and services to all customers interested in interacting with MTN through ‘Zigi’. Commenting on the launch of ‘Zigi,’ the Chief Customer Relations Officer, MTN Nigeria, Ugonwa Nwoye, said, “Zigi offers personalised, intuitive and prompt service to our customers. Her introduction will not take away the customer’s access to live agents but will serve as the first point of contact for customers who choose to interact with Zigi.’ We believe that ‘Zigi’ will ensure increased convenience which translates to better experiences for our customers, which is at the core of our purpose as a business.”
