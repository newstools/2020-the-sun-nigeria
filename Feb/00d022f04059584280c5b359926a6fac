The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has appointed former Super Eagles’ defender and captain, Joseph Yobo as assistant coach of the team. He replaces Imama Amapakabo in the three-time African champions’ technical crew. Yobo, who played for the Nigeria U-20 boys – Flying Eagles, during the FIFA World Youth Championship (now known as FIFA U-20 World Cup) in 1999, won his first cap for the senior team in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match away to Zambia in Chingola in April 2001 and played in three FIFA World Cup finals in 2002, 2010 and 2014. The attack-minded defender also played in six Africa Cup of Nations finals in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2013, capping it with leading the Super Eagles to their third continental title in South Africa in 2013. He played 100 matches for Nigeria at senior level. A thoroughbred and dedicated professional, who played his club football in five countries, including sterling appearances for Olympique Marseille in the French top flight, Fenerbahce in Turkey and Everton FC in the English Premiership, Joseph Yobo scored several crucial goals for the Super Eagles in important qualifying matches for the FIFA World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations. He was also among the scorers, when the Eagles thrashed South Africa’s Bafana Bafana 4-0 in a group phase match in Tunisia 16 years ago.
