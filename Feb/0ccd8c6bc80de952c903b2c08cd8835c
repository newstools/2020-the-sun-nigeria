Better days await manufacturers in Imo State as the Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, has committed to creating an enabling environment for them and industrialists in the state. The governor stated this when he received the Imo State Chapter of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) at the Government House in Owerri. He challenged them to attract investors to Imo State, saying  he was aware of the challenges facing them,  and gave assurance that his administration is keen on the revival of industries in the state. He said: “I am not unaware of your challenges. We are committed to ensuring that our state is industrialised and employment created  for our youths”. The governor promised that he would visit  the industrial layout along Onitsha Road after which a Joint Technical Committee would be set up to come up with a blue print on how  to resuscitate the industrial layout. While warning that government would not hesitate to revoke Certificates of Occupancy (CofO) issued to unserious allotees, Governor Uzodinma advised the manufacturers to attract investors to the state for optimal development. Speaking earlier, the MAN President, Chuma Eluma, thanked Governor Uzodimma for thinking outside the box in his quest to make the state a manufacturing hub in the South East. Eluma disclosed that the high cost of production in the state is associated with the deplorable state of roads at the industrial layout, inadequate power supply and constant extortion from security personnel. He called for the intervention of the state government to arrest some of these problems and promised that they would do their best to improve the manufacturing sector in the state for the betterment of Imo people.
