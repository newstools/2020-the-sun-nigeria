Zaria told journalists that the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Games which began as a recreational pastime between two companies, NNPC and Mobil had grown in leaps and bounds considering the increase in the number of participating companies and the number of sports that feature at the games. “This year, we have 12 companies participating. These include, NNPC, ExxonMobil, Total, Shell, Chevron, NAOC, DPR, SEPLAT and PTI. Others include NCDMB, NLNG and EROTON.” The NOGIG boss explained that there is zero chance of any company presenting non-staff as their representative. “We have a full-proof method that effectively checks and forestalls any use of mercenaries. Above all we are guided by the principle of intergrity in the oil industry,” Zaria said.
