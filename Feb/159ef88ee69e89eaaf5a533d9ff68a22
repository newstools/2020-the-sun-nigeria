 Benue State Chairman ofChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Akpen Leva has lamented that the country now organises more burials than celebration.  The state CAN chairman who was addressing Christian adherents during the rally said Christians have lost faith in the Nigeria nation as nowhere is safe anymore.  “Nigeria has more IDPs as a country than other nations; it is very unfortunate that this is happening in Nigeria. We as Christians need to pray for God’s intervention.” Earlier, the  vice chairman of CAN, Bishop Mike Angou in a his  sermon entitled, “Be a prepared Christian” charged Christians to prepare for prayer, stating that with prayer enemies of Christians will be crushed. The highpoint of the event was intense prayers bordering on security in Nigeria by the six blocks of CAN.
