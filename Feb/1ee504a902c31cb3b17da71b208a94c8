Fred Itua, Abuja Almost five years after he vacated office, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is closing in on former governor of Abia State, Theodore Orji. Orji who served between 2007-2015, Sunday Sun learnt, is currently under the radar of the anti-graft agency, which has allegedly traced billions of naira into bank accounts of his children. EFCC, acting on a comprehensive petition, dated March 17, 2017 and filed by ‘Fight Corruption: Save Nigeria Group,’ is said to have uncovered funds belonging to the state government, diverted to personal accounts. The petitioner had alleged that T.A Orji received and diverted various sums of monies that accrued to Abia State. According to the details of the petition, such monies were N383 billion revenue from federal accounts, N55 billion from Excess Crude Revenue, N2.3 billion Sure-P, N1.8 billion Ecological funds, N10.5 billion loan from First Bank of Nigeria through the Ministry of Chieftaincy and Local Government Affairs and N4 billion Loan from Diamond Bank. Others were N12 billion Paris Club refund, N2 billion Agricultural loan for farmer and N55 billion ASOPADEC funds. The petitioners alleged that the funds were received by the Abia State government, alleging that nothing could be shown to prove that the funds received were well used. A source told Sunday Sun that based on the petition, the EFCC commenced investigations and discovered that the former governor was drawing N500 million monthly purported to be security vote, which were being converted. “As he became the governor in 2007, he continued to draw the N500 million cash monthly from June 2007 to May 2015. “The N500 million, investigation revealed, is aside of the security funds expended on the Nigerian Police, the Nigerian Army, DSS, Navy anti-Kidnapping Squad, anti-robbery Squad, purchase of security equipment and vehicles for the security agencies. “Investigation was extended to his family members to ascertain the link and culpability of the alleged fraud. “The ex-governor’s first son, Chinedum Orji Enyinnaya  who is currently the Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly is now a frequent guest at the EFCC headquarters to throw light on his involvement in the fraud. “A check on his financial activities revealed that he had about 100 accounts in different banks, with over 80 per cent of the accounts still very active.
