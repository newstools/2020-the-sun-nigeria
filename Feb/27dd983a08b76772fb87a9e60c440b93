Also, the state fire service director, Japhet Okereafor, who said he was aware of the incident, when contacted noted that his men could not extinguish the fire because of the non-availability of a vehicle and even a driver to drive the vehicle. “I am aware of the fire incident but we don’t have enough vehicles and the only driver we have was not around,” Okereafor said.
