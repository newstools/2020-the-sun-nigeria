Nasarawa  State Ministry of Health has embarked on sensitisation campaign to markets to educate traders, especially those selling  food items on preventive measures against lassa fever in the state.  Dr Ibrahim Alhassan, Director of Public Health in the Ministry, told newsmen on Saturday at the  Lafia Ultra-modern market that the campaign became necessary as precautionary measure to check the spread of the disease in the state. Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the lassa virus and transmitted to human through contact with foods or household items contaminated with rodents’ faeces or urine.  Dr Alhassan encouraged traders, especially those selling food items such as garri, flour, fish, fruits and among others to ensure proper hygiene to guard against the virus.  He advised them to always cover food items properly to prevent rodent infestation both at home and in the markets.  “The essence of this campaign is to encourage the general public on the need to keep our environments clean, properly cover the food items to avoid contamination with rodents’ faeces or urine.  He listed the symptoms of the disease to include headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, cough and abdominal pain, while advised to promptly report such cases to the nearest health facility.  In  separate interviews with some traders, Juliet Ejike, Florence Ikenerem and Augustine Ugwu all  appreciated the state Ministry of health for bringing such sensitisation campaign to the markets.  The traders promised to observe strictly personal and environmental hygiene in order to guard against lassa fever.
