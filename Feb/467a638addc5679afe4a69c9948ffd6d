John Adams, Minna Following the expiration of the 21-day ultimatum given to Niger Stare government by the organised labour in the state for the full implementation of the N30,000 minimum wage, the labour has directed all civil servants in the state to proceed on an “indefinite strike action with effect from February 4, 2020.” The organised labour said the directive was “in compliance with the resolutions reached at the Emergency Joint States Executive Council (SEC) meeting of Niger State organised labour held at the labour house on January 29, 2020.” The organised labour in a letter to this effect dated Monday February 3, 2020, and signed by the state chairman, Comrade Yakubu Garba and secretary, Comrade Tanimu Yunusa, a copy which was made available to our correspondent in Minna, stated that the strike would be comprehensive and would remain in force until the government addressed all its demands.

It could be recalled that labour in a letter, titled “Notice of 21 days ultimatum of indefinite strike action,” jointly signed by the state chairman, Comrade Yakubu Garba, state chairman Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Yunusa D. Tanimu dated January 3, warned the government to implement the N30,000 minimum wage or face strike action.
