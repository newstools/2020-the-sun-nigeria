 Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Ondo State House of Assembly on Tuesday reconvened after weeks of recess to commence legislative work on the establishment of the state security network otherwise known as “Operation Amotekun.” The bill for the establishment of the security outfit which scaled through the first and second reading during the plenary was transited to the House committee on security for scrutiny and recommendations. The Speaker, Hon. Bamidele Oleyelogun hinted that principal officers of the House will alongside the clerk on February 26, 2020 join their counterparts across the other five South West states in Ibadan, Oyo State to harmonise their position on the bill. He said that posterity will be kind to all those involved in the setting up of ‘Operation Amotekun.’ The Speaker also disclosed that a public hearing on the bill will be held on February 24, 2020 in order to draw contributions from members of the public on how best to fortify the operations of the security outfit. The House, subsequently gave the committee one week to submit its report. Deliberating on the bill earlier sent to the lawmakers by the state governor, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, majority leader of the House, Hon. Jamiu Maito commended the governor for his courage and tenacity of purpose. The majority leader maintained that the importance of the bill cannot be overemphasised going by the increasing rate of kidnappings, ritual killings, and herdsmen attack among others. On his part, the Chairman, House Committee on Security, Hon. James Gbegudu said when operational,  Amotekun will fully heal the social vices currently encroaching on South West states. He added that the commencement of the legislative backing to the security outfit should be the happiest day in the history of the zone and the country at large as it signalled stakeholders’ commitment in the protection of lives and property. It would be recalled that governors in the six states of the South West had adopted a common security network codename ‘Amotekun’ in view of the threatening security issues in the zone. The Ondo State Executive Council had last week forwarded the bill on the establishment of the Ondo State Security Network Agency to the House of Assembly for approval and subsequent passage into law. When operational, the ‘Amotekun’ security network is expected to among other things enhance security in the South West States of Nigeria. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
