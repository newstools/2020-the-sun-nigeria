Air travel looks promising as a new Nigerian Airline, Green Africa Airways, has made firm order for 50 Airbus A220-300 aircraft. This is a major order to be placed globally for the A220-300 series and the largest ever from the African continent. The deal is seen as significant because Green Africa had originally expressed an interest in ordering a fleet of Boeing 737 Max. The Max has been grounded since March 2019 after two separate crashes killed 346 people. Babawande Afolabi, Founder & CEO of Green Africa Airways said, “Together with Airbus, we are incredibly proud to announce the largest order ever for the A220 from the African continent. The Nigerian carrier story is steeped in entrepreneurial boldness, strategic foresight and an unwavering commitment to using the power of air travel to create a better future”. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, Christian Scherer, speaking from the Singapore Airshow, added, “We are excited about the Green Africa project, its legitimate ambition and its professionalism, evidenced by their most discerning choice for their operating assets. The unique characteristics of the A220 will allow the airline to unlock destinations and route pairs that previously would have been considered nonviable. We look forward to our partnership with Green Africa and to accompany their development with the most efficient aircraft in its class”. The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and wide-body passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft.
