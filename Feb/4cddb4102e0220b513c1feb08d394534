Lawrence Enyoghasu with agency report Manchester City have been banned from European club competition in 2020/21 and 2021/22 after being found to have committed “serious breaches” of UEFA’s club licensing and financial fair play regulations. The reigning Premier League champions have also been fined 30m euros (£25m). The decision is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Manchester City say they are “disappointed but not surprised” by the “prejudicial” decision and will appeal. They added in a statement: “The club has always anticipated the ultimate need to seek out an independent body and process to impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence in support of its position. “In December 2018, the UEFA chief investigator publicly previewed the outcome and sanction he intended to be delivered to Manchester City, before any investigation had even begun. “The subsequent flawed and consistently leaked UEFA process he oversaw has meant that there was little doubt in the result that he would deliver. The club has formally complained to the UEFA disciplinary body, a complaint which was validated by a CAS ruling. “Simply put, this is a case initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA. With this prejudicial process now over, the club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the earliest opportunity.”
