On statutory allocation, he said the Area Council’s personnel cost had N2 billion, while N900 million was for over head cost. The Chairman noted that his administration placed great premium on capital projects to meet the needs of the people. “The budget has critically examined all the problems associated with poor management of finances and violation of regulations. “Our mandate to deliver the much expected dividends of democracy to the electorate is seriously threatened by the gloomy financial profile of previous administration,” he said.
