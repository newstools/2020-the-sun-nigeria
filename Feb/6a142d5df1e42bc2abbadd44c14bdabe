Stock market analysts have projected a negative outing for Nigerian equities next week and warned investors to shift their focus in fundamental stocks. This is coming after the momentum in the nation’s bourse weakened at the close of transactions on Friday as the market recorded its first weekly loss for the year following five consecutive days of losses– largest weekly loss since the week ended April 5, 2019 (-4.6 per cent) – bringing the Year-to-Date (YtD) return to +7.5 per cent. As such, the market capitalisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) dipped by N404.5 billion to close at N14.8 trillion while the All Share Index (ASI) fell by 2.65 per cent to close at 28,843.53 points. Speaking to Sunday Sun via telephone, a stockbroker, Mr Charles Sakrogha, attributed the market’s negative performance to the policies guiding the economy. He said: “The stock market’s performance is reflective of policies guiding the economy, but this situation is normal for a market especially an emerging one as we are bound to have profit, as well as losses. There has to be flunctuations in prices because if there is no flunctuation, then it is not a market. What we saw in the previous week was positivity all through so we had expected people to take profit this week”. Cordros Capital in their weekly assessment of the market, said that the trend witnessed this week is likely to persist as the dual impacts of the weakening sentiment and mixed earnings performances during earnings season are expected to pressure market return. “Nonetheless, we advise investors to focus on taking positions in fundamentally justified stocks”, they said. On their part, analysts at Afrinvest said: “We believe that the market would continue this downtrend, especially as earnings released this week has been largely mixed and insufficient to boost investor confidence”. Meanwhile, performance across sectors was bearish as four of six indices declined. The Insurance and Consumer Goods indices gained 0.9 and 0.1 per cent respectively due to buying interest in Linkage Assurance (+18.8 per cent) and Vitafoam (+10.0 per cent).
