The 2020 GTB Lagos International Polo Tournament galloped off on an exciting  note yesterday with Lagos Wontra bagging a 6-5 win over Lagos Almina Group, while Golden Alchemy outplayed Lagos Dania A+ 10-4 in Silver Cup encounters. Wontra, formed by Charles Oluwole, Altaf Abubakar, Yemo Alakija and Aliyu Tijani underlined their intentions from the start, with Tijani scoring with an inside shot with barely 20 seconds inside the keenly-contested Stream A game, but none of the sides was able to hit target till the chukka elapsed. Altaf made it 2-0 for Wontra,as he scored in the opening seconds of the second chukka before two-goaler Tijanii, who was the man of the match, scored again to make it 3-0 with a solo goal having picked the ball in the 60 yards. Rabiu Mohammed scored Almina’s first goal, but Tijani restored  Wontra’s three-goal lead almost immediately converting a low shot, but Almina, which also featured Ahmadu Husaini, Omoruyi Giwa-Osagie and Yasin Amusan won’t give up yet, as Mohammed scored a 40-yard to keep the game alive. Giwa-Osagie’s goal kept the match on knife edge, finishing off a move orchestrated by team captain, Yasin Amusan, but Tijani again scored before the clock beeped for a 5-2 second chukka lead for Wontra.
