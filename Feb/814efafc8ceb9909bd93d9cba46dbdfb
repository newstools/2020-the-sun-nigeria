Interswitch Limited, a leading technology-driven company focused on the digitisation of payments in Nigeria and other countries in Africa, and American Express (AmEx), are pleased to announce a new partnership to expand the usage and acceptance of American Express Cards across Nigeria. The partnership with Interswitch will enable American Express Cardmembers to transact using a wide range of merchants, who process payments through the Interswitch platform, for a range of travel, retail, hospitality and dining expenses, as well as ATM withdrawals. The partnership will also allow Interswitch to integrate its network of merchants in Nigeria into the global American Express network. As part of the agreement, Interswitch will assume responsibility for managing American Express merchants in Nigeria, while bringing new merchants onto its platform. Previously, American Express Cardmembers could only use their cards at select locations across the country. This new partnership broadens that acceptance to Interswitch merchants, ATMs and websites nationwide. Akeem Lawal, Divisional Chief Executive Officer for Payment Processing at Interswitch said: “AmEx and Interswitch are aligned in our desire to provide fast and secure payment solutions and transactions across Nigeria. With this new partnership, we are improving AmEx Cardmember access to a convenient and secure network, which also benefits our merchants who will gain new opportunities presented by an expanded user base. By remaining card scheme neutral, Interswitch will continue to explore innovative partnerships that will benefit consumers and retailers alike.” Lawal also reiterated the commitment of Interswitch to reliably cater to its valued merchants, to reinforce the Company’s mantra of ‘Transaction solutions you can depend on’. He recommended new merchants join the Interswitch platform, highlighting that the addition of American Express cards can help to expand their businesses.
