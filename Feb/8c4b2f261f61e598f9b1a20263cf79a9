A 31-year-old company manager, Bright Marcus, who allegedly stole N914,900 from the proceeds of the company sales, was on Wednesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court.

The prosecutor alleged that the defendant also failed to remit the proceeds of phone assesories and power bank sales into the company’s account. “The total amount of the stolen money is N914, 900, property of Slot Systems Limited,” he said.

The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The offence contravenes Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Chief Magistrate, Mr J. A. Adegun, admitted the defendant to N250,000 bail with two sureties in like sum. Adegun adjourned the case until March 11, for mention. (NAN)
