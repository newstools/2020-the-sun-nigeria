The Supreme Court has fixed this Wednesday to hear the application by the All Progressives Congress (APC) seeking the reversal of its February 13, 2020 judgment disqualifying the party’s candidate in the last governorship election in Bayelsa State, Lyon David Pereworimin. Our correspondent  learnt on Sunday that hearing notices have already been issued to all parties by the Registry of the Court. In the application filed on February 20, 2020 by its team of lawyers led by Wole Olanipekun (SAN), the APC wants the Supreme Court to set aside some portions of its judgment. They include where it “wrongly” held that the Federal High Court disqualified its governorship candidate along with its deputy governorship candidate; and where it held that joint ticket of its candidates was vitiated by the disqualification of the deputy governorship candidate and that both candidates are deemed not to be candidates in the election.
