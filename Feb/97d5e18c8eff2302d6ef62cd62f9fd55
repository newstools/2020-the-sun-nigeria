We enjoyed the stiff competition and I am particularly happy that the members also enjoyed themselves during the competition,” Okubena said. “There are plans to stage more competitions, but I am pleased that the very first one went well in all aspects. The players had a nice time on and off the courts because there was a conducive atmosphere of friendliness.” In the final of the tournament, the pair of Kayode Awokoya /Sesan Dada defeated Bimbo Okubena/Segun Abijo 3-6, 6-1, 10-8; while Falase Clara/Patricia Suliemon defeated the pair of Sharon Momoh/Olowola Bekeme 7-6,6-3.
