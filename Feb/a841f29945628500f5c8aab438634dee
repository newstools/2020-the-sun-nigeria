Fortune has smiled on young Nigerian junior Olympic triple jump athlete, Ineh Oritsemeyiwa, with the Minister of Youth and Sports, Mr Sunday Dare providing his ticket to pursue further studies side by side with sports, through scholarship in the United States. The minister facilitated his trip after two failed efforts at securing visa and ticket, due to financial constraints. Speaking when the athlete paid the minister a thank you and farewell visit in his office, in Abuja, Dare urged him to be a good ambassador of Nigeria by staying focused as he prepares for the Olympics in Tokyo.
