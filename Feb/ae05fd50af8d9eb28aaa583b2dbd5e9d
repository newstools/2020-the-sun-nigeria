Reports  have it that the Assembly wants the security issue to be treated as a matter of urgency. After the legislators took turns to criticize the security situation in the state, Alhaji Abdullahi Wuse, the speaker , took the members to task, urging the committee on security and other members to interface with heads of security agencies and relevant security stakeholders in the state to tackle the menace. Bosso had raised a serious alarm over insecurity in most parts of the state particularly in Gurumana, Shiroro local government area, where over 300 bandits recently ravaged and carted away cattle and property worth millions of naira.
