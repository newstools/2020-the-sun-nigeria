I suspect that she is having an affairs with the pastor. “Before the unfortunate incident occurred, I came back from work sometime in January this year only to find out from my children that their mother had left the house. It was Pastor Friday that scattered my home. “For three days I was looking for her ,but on the fourth day, I discovered that she had moved in to stay with the pastor. When I went there I saw her wearing only wrapper while the pastor was wearing only boxers.” “When I tried to confront her, Pastor Friday  gave me the beating of my life. He  said I should leave his house. Before I knew what was happening, he had  wrestled me to the ground. “All attempts  I made to ensure that she returned to the house were rebuffed. On January 16, I went to her school located at Ladi-Lak, Bariga area of Lagos, only to find her standing by the gate.”
