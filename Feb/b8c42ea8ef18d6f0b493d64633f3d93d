The embattled President of the Powerlifting Federation of Nigeria, Queen Uboh-Idris has been suspended  by the board over series of  allegations, such as   unilaterally running the board, misappropriation and highhandeness. The suspension came on the heels of  the board rejection of  Uboh-Idris’ purported resignation  deemed not  to have followed  dues process making it invalid. The board had also set up  a panel to probe  her fundraising activities for the just concluded Para Powerlifting World Cup, for which she was alleged to have received donations into her private banks accounts instead of the federation’s account. She is also alleged to have repeatedly withheld information from other board members about the just conluded  World Cup.
