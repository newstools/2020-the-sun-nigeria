The Commissioner, who explained that Novel Coronavirus is a highly infectious disease that manifests with fever, cough or difficulty in breathing, advised residents in the state to imbibe the habits of personal hygiene with frequent washing of hands, cough etiquette and to also avoid crowded places, “because these are proven factors in reducing risk of spread of the disease which can be spread from person to person through droplets from cough, sneezing or spitting of saliva.” The Commissioner’s statement further explained that the virus can survive in these droplets in the hands, on surfaces of items such as doorknobs, tables and utensils from where they can be contracted. “The public is advised to remain calm and disregard unfounded information and myths being circulated especially in social media while seeking for verified information from relevant authorities. Any person with the symptoms as described should report to the nearest health facility for further assessment by health care workers,” Dr Gana said.
