John Adams, Minna Bandits  numbering over 60 Wednesday morning invaded Madaka, and neighbouring communities in  Rafi Local Government  Area of Niger State  and abducted scores. The bandits who stormed the communities in motorcycles at about 6:30am fired gunshots into the air ,forcing  the villagers to run for safety. This latest attacks is coming barely four days after a Police Inspector attached to Bangi police division, Ibrahim Mitra Chibok, was killed by bandits after a gun battle with the police. According to a source closed to the communities, over 100 heads of cattle were  rustled and scores  of villagers abducted  in the operation which lasted for  hours without confrontation by security agents. A source said those who were  abducted  by the bandits,  were  used as shields by the bandits  for their escape. “The bandits after the attack, headed  towards Allawa in Shiroro LGA. We cannot say  whether there  is  any  casualty until the situation  returns to normal. You can see men of the Nigerian Air Force everywhere as they responded  to the distress calls. You can see  helicopters hovering  the air looking for  the bandits”. Efforts to get the Chairman of the Rafi  Local Government Council, Mr Ismaila Isa Modibo, for comment was abortive as his cell phone was switched off. However, the Director -General of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, Ahmed Ibrahim Inga, said: “We received the report some minutes ago, but I don’t have the details yet”.
