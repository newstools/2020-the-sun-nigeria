Louis Ibah Green Africa Airways has sealed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the purchase of 50 Airbus 220-300 aircraft, the largest ever from an African airline. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer, Christian Scherer, in his reaction to the deal at the Singapore Airshow, expressed excitement with the purchase order from Green Airways. “We are excited about the Green Africa project, its legitimate ambition, and its professionalism, evidenced by their most discerning choice for their operating assets. The unique characteristics of the A220 will allow the airline to unlock destinations and route pairs that previously would have been considered non-viable. We look forward to our partnership with Green Africa and to accompany their development with the most efficient aircraft in its class,” Scherer said. Founder/CEO of Green Africa Airways, Mr. Babawande Afolabi said “together with Airbus, we are incredibly proud to announce the largest order ever for the A220-300 aircraft from the African continent. The Green Africa story is a story of entrepreneurial boldness, strategic foresight and an unwavering commitment to using the power of air travel to create a better future.” The A220 is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market; it delivers unbeatable fuel efficiency and wide-body passenger comfort in a single-aisle aircraft. The A220 brings together state-of-the-art aerodynamics, advanced materials and Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines to offer at least 20 percent lower fuel burn per seat compared to previous generation aircraft, along with significantly lower emissions and a reduced noise footprint. The A220 offers the performance of larger single-aisle aircraft. At the end of January 2020, the A220 had accumulated 658 orders.
