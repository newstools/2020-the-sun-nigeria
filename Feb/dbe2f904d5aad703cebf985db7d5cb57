Gyang Bere, Jos The Jos Electricity Distribution Company (JED) said the increased  in tariff for electricity consumers will boost electricity supply and attract huge investors into the country. Head of Corporate, Planning and Strategy, Jos Electricity Distribution (JED), Oluwashola Agal,  disclosed this yesterday during a public consulation on extraordinary tariff review application, held in Jos, Plateau State. He noted that despite JED had  not made any profit since it took over the distribution of electricity in Plateau, Benue, Bauchi and Gombe  in 2013, it has always tried to meet the need of its customers by supplying electricity at the affordable rate. “We were mandated to hold  consutation with our customers in respect to the tariff review, this is holding simultaneously in Plateau, Benue and Gombe state. “ We are also meeting with key  customers and communities to explain the rationale behind the increase in tariff to the customers. The increase will boost electricity supply to attract investors and companies to our catchment area. “The increase in cost is actually coming from the market because the generation cost has increased, the TCN cost has also increased. We have look at the challenges of unemployment, in terms of inflation and the fact that we intend to attract more companies and investors that will create employment opportunities to youths within our catchment area.” He noted that the tariff was reviewed for customers with single phase from N29.81k to N32.94k which amount to 10 percent increase for both single and double phases. Meanwhile, most consumers  who spoke at the gathering rejected the tariff review and lamented over billing and poor power supply.
