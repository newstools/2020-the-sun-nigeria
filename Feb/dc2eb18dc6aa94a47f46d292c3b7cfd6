Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has commended the founder and former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Konga, Mr Simdul Shagaya, for his sound technological initiatives and prowess. Lalong made the commendation in a letter signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Danladi Abok-Otu, and made available to newsmen in Jos on Tuesday. The governor said that Shagaya’s technological initiatives had hugely been a boost to the economy of the state. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Shagaya is the founder, U Lessons Education, an App built to facilitate education accessibility and learning across Africa. U Lessons Education, based in Lagos with a production studio in Jos, is integrating mobile platforms, Security Digital Cards, culture specific curriculum and a network of tutors.
