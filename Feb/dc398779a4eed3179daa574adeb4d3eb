The group in a statement by its coordinator, Samson Momorin, also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to directly intervene in the crisis, pointing out that the state had been turned to a theatre of war where some persons are benefiting from the crisis. “Edo State being a peaceful place has become a crisis and troubled state where some principal officers are enjoying the crisis while the masses are suffering. “We are calling on Mr President to wade into the matter causing the crisis as the number one citizen of the country,” the group said. It alleged that some of the governorship aspirants for the  governorship election in the state cannot figure out the real problem of the citizens of the state and have no idea on how to solve the problems of the state. “We are also using this opportunity to call on the Independent National Electoral Commissioner (INEC) to be fair in it’s duties because all eyes will be on them both for the primary and the main election,” the statement added.‎ Meanwhile, one of the trucks used in blocking Okoro-Otun road, near the residence of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, in Benin City, has been removed. At press time, the second truck that was set on fire by yet to be identified persons, was still burning.
