Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has reiterated that the state is ready to host the National Sports Festival (NSF) scheduled to hold next month, noting that facilities for the various competitions are ready for use. Obaseki, who was on an inspection tour of facilities at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, said the swimming pool, lawn tennis courts, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), power and security systems were all ready for the games. The governor, however, assured that the gymnastics complex, which is over 90 per cent complete, would be ready within the next 10 days. Edo State will host athletes from across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for the national event, scheduled to hold in March. He noted: “I’ve been assured by the contractor that the gymnasium hall will be ready in 10 days because all the materials are already here. The centre court of lawn tennis has also been completed. Overall, we have a very competent contractor on site and with the resources available to him, we will be able to complete the job and get the workers out of the site and commence the games.” The governor said: “In terms of parking spaces, we have been able to locate spaces not too far from the stadium, from where people will be transported to the stadium so that we will be able to manage the traffic.” He noted that athletes representing Edo State would be coming into camp next week, while the state has identified and secured over 11,000 spaces of accommodation for visiting athletes from other states, adding, “We have institutions around town, and the hotels have been very supportive.”
