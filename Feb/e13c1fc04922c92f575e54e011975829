He said that reviving the Delta ports would have positive impact on hospitality business, transportation and other Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and improve  the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Asite appealed to the federal government to ensure that the Warri/Escravos channel remained deep for bigger vessels to navigate without hinderances. He suggested a standby dredger at the Escravos bar to constantly sweep the estuary. NAN recalls that contract for the dredging was approved in 2018  while work on the Escravos channel was competed in 2019. A source at the Nigeria Ports Authority, Warri, confided that the second phase of the project would soon commence. (NAN)
