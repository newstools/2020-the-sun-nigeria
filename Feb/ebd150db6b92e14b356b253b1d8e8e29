Performance across sectors was lacklustre as only one of the six indices gained. The Consumer Goods Index (-6.5 per cent) led the losers’ chart due to price declines in Guinness (-16.6 per cent), Vitafoam (-12.1 per cent) and Nestle (-10.0 per cent). The Insurance (-2.2 per cent) and Oil & Gas (-0.7 per cent) indices trailed on the back of sell-offs in Linkage Assurance (-25.8 per cent), MRS Oil (-9.8 per cent) and Oando (-4.2 per cent). Similarly, price declined in Wema Bank (-8.5 per cent), Sterling Bank (-7.7 per cent) and MTNN (-0.9 per cent) dragged the AFR-ICT (-0.5 per cent) and Banking (-0.2 per cent) indices. On the flip side, the Industrial Goods Index (+0.8 per cent) emerged the lone gainer owing to price appreciation in WAPCO (+1.3 per cent) and BUA Cement (+1.1 per cent). Meanwhile, a total turnover of 912.175 million shares worth N12.126 billion in 17,083 deals were traded during the week by investors on the floor of the Exchange, in contrast to a total of 1.478 billion shares valued at N20.295 billion that exchanged hands last week in 23,263 deals.

Analysts believe the stock market would continue to experience losses even as they noted that the market would record positivity at the end of the first quarter.
Speaking during the Capital Market Correspondents Association of Nigeria (CAMCAN) first quarter forum in Lagos recently, the Managing Director, APT Securities and Fund Limited, Mallam Kurfi Garba, said that the market is expected to close in double digits by the end of the year 2020. While offering insights to performance of the market in 2019, Garba explained that the performance of the market on quarterly basis was the worst in the last 10 years with negative returns in all the quarters. He attributed the performance to the tensed polity in the build up to the 2019 election and dampened investors’ confidence. According to him,  “the All Share Index is likely going to close for the year 2020 in positive and may close in double digits. Both technical analysis and fundamental analysis move to the positive direction. However, the market may experience volatility because of the changes in the reporting financial reports as adopted by the exchange without adequate awareness of the brokers”.
In a note to Sunday Sun, analysts at Afrinvest said: “We believe that the market would continue this downward trend as investors remain shy of equities”.
On their part, Cordros Capital, said: “In our view, the trend witnessed this week is likely to persist, as weakening market sentiment and the absence of positive catalysts are expected to pressure market returns. Nonetheless, we advise investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks”.
