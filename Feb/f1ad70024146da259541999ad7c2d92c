The letter which was obtained by our correspondent in Asaba, Delta State, was dated January 30, 2020. It read: “I am directed to invite you to a public hearing of the Senate Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions of the National Assembly in respect of a petition, you wrote o behalf of Mr. Otobha Philip Brain against Engr. Williams Akionbare, Dr. Onanuju and Federal University of Technology (FUTO), Owerri for alleged victimisation, extortion and criminal breach of duty and sent to the Senate. The matter has been referred to the committee for detailed investigation and further legislative action.” In the petition, Otobha, an engineering student of FUTO alleged that the institution and the two lecturers stalled his graduation for over years now. Otobha who hails from Emede in Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State, attributed his inability to graduate from FUTO since 2014 on the alleged criminal actions and inaction of certain officials of the institution.
