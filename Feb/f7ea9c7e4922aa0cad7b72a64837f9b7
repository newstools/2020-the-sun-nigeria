John Adams, Minna As the strike declared by the Organised Labour in Niger State entered its third day today,  paralysing government activities, the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked Governor Abubakar Sani Bello,  to pay the workers the “ legally agreed minimum wage “. The party lamented that  it was shocking  that Bello who almost a year ago boasted that he was ready to pay the new minimum wage of N30,000 passed by the National Assembly and signed into law by Mr. President had failed to do so” In a statement by the  PDP chairman, Tanko Beji, the party  said it was regrettable that  Bello had abandoned the state . It noted with dismay that  the strike action had completely paralyzed all hospitals and essential services in the  state. ‘‘It is regretable that Governor Sani Bello would allow a labour dispute about wages and rights of workers  to culminate into a total strike action” While describing the situation as  “a classic case of dereliction of duty”., the party added: “It is against this backdrop  that the PDP calls on the governor and his party to immediately pay workers their legally approved salaries, provide political and strategic leadership to the security architecture or immediately resign or the Assembly should do the needful”. Beji, also asked the APC government to find solutions to the increasing cases of insecurity in the state which he claimed had led to loss of lives and property and displaced many villagers from their ancestral homes. The strike, particularly in Minna, the state capital  is already taking its tool on the ordinary man with the abscence of medical personnel in public health institutions and scarcity of potable water in most communities. It was further gathered that relations of patients  have started diverting their sick ones to private clinics while water vendors have started making brisk business.
