The market capitalisation of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday dropped to N14 trillion mark due to persistent profit taking. Specifically, the market capitalisation which opened at N15.132 trillion shed N138 billion or 0.91 per cent to close at N14.994 trillion. Also, the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 267.73 points, representing a loss of 0.91 per cent to close at 29,110.90 against 29,378.63 on Tuesday. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are MTN Nigeria, Guaranty Trust Bank, Unilever, UACN and BOC Gases. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData, attributed the three days pull back to investors reactions to the outcome of the first Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Omordion said investors were trying to ascertain the implication of the Cash Reserve Ratio adjustment to the economy. “This correction is expected to create opportunity for repositioning ahead of full year earnings reports,” he stated. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said that “Despite weak investor sentiment, we maintain our bullish outlook for the equities market in the near term.” Consequently, market breadth closed negative, with 10 gainers and 18 losers.
