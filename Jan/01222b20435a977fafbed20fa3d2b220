Super Falcons midfielder, Rita Chikwelu netted her first goal for Madrid Ladies, as they beat visiting Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in the Spanish women’s Primera Iberdrola on Sunday. Chikwelu who made her second appearance for Madrid Ladies, scored to make it 2-0 in the eight minute. The win was Madrid’s first win since 29 September 2019, after going 11 straight games without a win. Other scorers for Madrid Ladies are Antonia, Geyse and Laura. Athletic Bilbao’s goal was scored by Lucia Garcia which made it 3-1. The win took Madrid Ladies to 12th on 15 points in the 16-team league table. Meanwhile, compatriot Charity Adule netted the winner for Eibar as they overcame Parquesol 1-0 in Sunday’s Reto Iberdrola encounter. The Nigeria striker had scored seven goals in her previous 12 matches, with her last in Eibar’s 4-0 win over Sporting Gijon on January 5. Having missed being on the scoresheet in a 4-2 win at Osasuna last week, Adule ensured her second-half strike was enough to help the hosts secure their fourth win in a row this season. The 26-year-old, who was in action for 68 minutes, has now scored eight goals in 13 matches this season for Iker Dorronsoro’s side.
