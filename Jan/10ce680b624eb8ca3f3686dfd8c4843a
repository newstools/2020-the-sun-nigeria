Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja The Government of India, has expressed gratitude to the Federal Government over the release of Indian seafarers who were kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea.

Indian High Commissioner to Nigeria, Abhay Thakur, while speaking during the 70th anniversary of India’s Republic Day in Abuja, thanked the Federal Government for its assistance in ensuring the release of the Indian nationals.
