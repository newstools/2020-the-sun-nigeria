Former President Goodluck Jonathan has urged Niger Delta youths to shun acts of violence and embrace peace to ease the execution of projects that would ensure the development of the region. Jonathan gave the advice when officials of Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), Worldwide, and Niger Delta Youth Leaders, visited him to commiserate with him over the attack on his residence in Otuoke. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the former President’s residence in Otuoke, Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa, was attacked on Dec. 24, 2019 by gunmen. Jonathan, while thanking his visitors for the concern, admonished them to shun any act of violence as no nation could develop in an atmosphere of criminality and violence. The former president said that there was no reason for the attack, pointing out that he had done his own part for the development Nigeria as nation. He called on security agencies to ensure that those who carried out the act were brought to book. Earlier, President of IYC, Mr Pereotubo Oweilaemi, had called on security agencies to ensure the unmasking of the perpetrators of the attack. “The attack on former President Jonathan’s home at Otuoke is really embarrassing. The perpetrators of that dastardly act should not go unpunished. Security agencies should ensure they fish out those hoodlums. “We are calling on the neighbouring communities around Otuoke to cooperate with the security agencies in order to fish out those bandits,” he said. Also speaking, Mr Kennedy West, a youth leader, said that it was saddening that people from the region could plan an attack on the former president. He said that there was no reason to justify that attack. (NAN)
