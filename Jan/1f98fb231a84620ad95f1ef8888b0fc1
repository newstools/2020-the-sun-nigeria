Responding, Bello who was represented by the state deputy governor, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso said Niger has a sustained relationship with the traditional rukers in the state. “We will continue to make the traditional institution relevant and also sustain the existing relationship,” he said. He said that the roles of traditional leaders in the country must be supported and respected in view of their significance as the custodian of cultures of every society. The governor noted that many social vices in the country could be tackled if the traditional institutions are strengthened and recognised by governments at all levels. He said that Ewuare’s visit would further strengthen the long cordial relationship existing between the two states.
