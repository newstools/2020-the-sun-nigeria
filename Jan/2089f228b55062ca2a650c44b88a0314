But having conquered Nollywood, Johnson is also winning accolades on the home front. Recall that she has always talked about having four kids. Well, itâ€™s a double for her! TS Weekend can authoritatively say that baby number four is on the way for the thespian. Who else broke the news if not Mercy Johnson herself? Yes, she flamboyantly displayed her baby bump to the delight of the audience recently! Set in the ancient kingdoms of Igala and Bini, The Legend of Inikpi was directed by Frank Rajah and tells the story of two great kingdoms on the brink of war. When the oracle informs King Attah of Igala kingdom of the human sacrifice demanded by the gods of Benin, the monarch plunges into despair.
