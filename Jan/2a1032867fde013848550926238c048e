According to the Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Muhammad Bello, Tambuwal replaces outgoing Bayelsa State governor, Seriake Dickson, who was absent at the meeting and whose tenure will elapse on February 3. The choice of Governor Tambuwal was unanimous as all the governors in attendance at the party’s 88th National Executive Council (NEC) holding at the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata plaza, Abuja, resolved and appointed him as their chairman. Accepting the onerous responsibility, Gov Tambuwal pledged to run an inclusive administration and to move the party forward.
