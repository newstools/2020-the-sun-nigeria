Fred Itua, Abuja Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign over what he regards as the inability of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government to address the security challenges in the country. Abaribe spoke on Wednesday on the floor of the Senate during a debate on insecurity in the country. He said: “Nigeria didn’t elect the IGP. We didn’t elect other service chiefs. We elected the APC government in 2015. We are asking this government to resign because it can no longer perform its role.”
