The trial of Yakubu Jekada, one of the accused persons charged with  the misappropriation of N35 million belonging to  JAMB, was stalled in an FCT High Court, Maitama, due to the defendant counsel’s ill-health. Responding, Mr Gyang Zi, counsel to Jekada, prayed for an adjournment. “I took ill yesterday before I left Jos. I am feeling funny, and I went to get some drugs thinking it would help me out. “But it continued, I sincerely apologise for the inconveniences it would cause the court and others, including the witnesses,” Zi said. Iheanacho said that the learned counsel has presented a sympathetic picture before the court based on health. “So, we will not be objecting to his application for adjournment,” Iheanacho said. After listening to the lawyers, Justice Peter Affen adjourned the matter until March 3, for continuation of trial. (NAN)
