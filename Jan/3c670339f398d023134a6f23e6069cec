He was said to have been shot dead at about 4:30p.m at Igboora, the headquarters of Ibarapa Central Local Government Area of Oyo State in his car n his way to Iseyin. The Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the murder of Yusuf, who is also the founder of De-Fayus International, and says it has launched a manhunt for his killers. Traditional herbal products from his companies include Yoyo Bitters and Fijk Flusher. As gathered, the deceased departed Lagos for Iseyin on Oke-Ogun axis of Oyo State and he was used to passing through Abeokuta, Igboora, Eruwa, Maya, and Ado-Awaye to Iseyin. But he was unlucky on Thursday evening as he was said to have been shot dead by yet-to-be-identified gunmen on Igboora-Eruwa Road in Oyo State.

The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the state, Mr Olugbenga Fadeyi, said Yusuf was killed around 4:30pm, adding that the Commissioner of Police in the state, Shina Olukolu, had led some senior police officers to the scene of the assassination for an on-the-spot fact-finding mission.
