Paul Erewuba The case involving former Nigeria international, Nwankwo Kanu, and AMCON over the takeover of his hotel will resume on January 28 at the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, Lagos as the parties involved hope for a final resolution. A Federal High Court had ordered that the hotel named Hardley Apartments and located on Waziri Ibrahim Crescent on Victoria Island, Lagos, be locked up after an unresolved issue with AMCON dating back to 2015. But matters took a disturbing twist early last year when some unknown persons defied the court order by taking over the property and converted it to their own use. It led Kanu to cry out upon discovering that the property worth billions of naira, including an Olympic gold medal and other trophies he won during his playing career, had been looted by the illegal occupiers of the property. The situation also sparked national outrage, considering Kanu’s remarkable service to Nigeria in the sport and health sectors. “This is clearly an act of lawlessness and impunity that should no longer be condoned,” Kanu had said. The Federal High Court heard the case on June 17, 2015 but it was adjourned till October 15, 2019 due to vacation in the nation’s judiciary, after which it was adjourned to January 28, 2020 and assigned to a new judge. Latest findings however revealed that the illegal occupiers of the Hardley Apartments have remained on the property in defiance of the court orders.
