Monica Iheakam Former Super Falcons star, Perpetua Nkwocha has expressed delight over Nigeria and Barcelona striker, Asisat Oshoala equaling the feat as the African Woman Footballer of the Year.

Nwkocha, a former four-time winner of the prestigious award, via her Instagram page showered encomiums on Oshoala, urging her to break more records in the game. “I remember vividly when you were asked in an interview whom you looked up to as a young star and you called my name and I smiled because I’ve seen you play. ‘What do you do if Lionel Messi says he look up to you? You just smile. ‘Congratulations star girl, make and break the records girl. The world at your feet,” Nkwocha wrote. The Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare has also congratulated the 2014 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup golden boot winner.
