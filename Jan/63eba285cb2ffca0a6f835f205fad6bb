Chairman of the Board of the company and NNPC Chief Operating Officer, Corporate Services, Mr Farouk Sa’id, who made the disclosure at the maiden Annual General Meeting of NPSC in Abuja attributed the improved performance to increased availability of the company’s storage facilities as well as a boost in products import by the Direct Sale and Direct Purchase programme which encouraged the movement of products through jetties.

The COO, CS added that the company recorded pipeline and storage availability of 64 per cent and 82 per cent on the average, stressing that a jetty throughput of 6,289million litres indicated a 181 per cent performance and a 47 per cent growth from 2017 operations.
