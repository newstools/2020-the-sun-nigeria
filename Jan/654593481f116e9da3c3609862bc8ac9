Emeka Anokwuru In commemoration of its 10th anniversary, Southern Sun Ikoyi has unveiled its refurbished 181 guest-rooms, meeting rooms and boardrooms to heighten expectation of guests looking to enjoy a wholesome experience of business and leisure at the hotel.

Such experience is one not alien to Southern Sun  and has earned it accolades and recognitions from premium travel and hospitality sites, local industry award platforms and renowned guests in its over ten years of operation. “At Southern Sun Ikoyi, we spare no expense in getting the best resources available in upgrading our guest rooms, meeting and boardrooms, WiFi infrastructure, security surveillance amongst other resources in consistently improving our services and ensuring that our guests have a complete hospitality experience within a soothing ambience. This will further heighten their nostalgia for repeated visits of the signature services received exclusively at the hotel compared to none,” Mark concluded.
