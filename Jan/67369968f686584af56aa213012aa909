He, however, said five persons died, among them, three adult males, one adult female and one five-year-old girl child. He said  20 people were treated for minor injuries and discharged at the scene of the accident, while 150 people including children have been displaced. A damage assessment also showed that 20 houses were affected by the fire. The buildings are at Ile Epo Ekoro road, Alimosho Local Government Area, and includes a storey building at No 18 Musa Erimo Street,  four houses at Joel Nnadede Street and 17 shops.
