Justice Abang had, on Thursday, adjourned the trial till Jan. 31 at the instance of the defence. At the resumed trial on Friday, the EFCC lawyer, Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, told the court that he was ready for the trial and that the 4th prosecution witness (PW4) was in court. “My Lord, the witness cannot speak fluently so he will require an interpreter,” he said. Giving his evidence-in-chief before the court, Umar , who spoke through an interpreter, said his office is located at Zone 4 Plaza, Abuja. “I buy and sell money. I buy and sell American dollars. I transact my business in Fanffash Resources,” he said. He said in 2014, the former governor sent for him to meet him (Suswam) at his residence in Maitama District, Abuja. They were accused by the EFCC of diverting the money which was said to be part of the proceeds of the sale of some shares of Benue State in a company. Suswam, a senator, is presently representing Benue North-East Senatorial District at the National Assembly. (NAN)
