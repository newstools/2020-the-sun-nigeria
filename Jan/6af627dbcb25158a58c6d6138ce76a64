Despite experiencing two consecutive losses, market analysts have said that the Nigerian stock market is likely to experience strong bullish run next week.
This is even as the market closed transactions for the week in the positive territory as the All Share Index (ASI) of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) appreciated by 0.69 per cent thanks to strong sentiments in the shares of Forte Oil, MTNN and GT Bank.
The market continued its bullish streak on Monday, recording 0.74 per cent following investors’ interest in MTNN after Nigeria’s Attorney General cancelled a $2 billion demand issued a year ago against the telecommunications operator for unpaid taxes. Consequently, market capitalisation closed at N15.287 trillion while Year-to-Date (YtD) return jumped to 10.4 per cent. Tuesday’s session, however, saw equities market closing negative, as the benchmark index pared by 1.18 per cent – the first decline in 2020 – to settle at 29,283.15 points. The loss reportedly was spurred by investor sell-offs in MTNN, Nigerian Breweries and Dangote Cement. Investors took profit for the second time this week on Wednesday as the ASI fell by 0.8 per cent as market capitalisation dropped N114 billion to close at N15 trillion.
However, gains recorded in the shares of Dangote Cement, MTNN and GT Bank, pushed the index up by 1.0 per cent at the close of business on Thursday.
Consequently, the Year-to-Date (YTD) return improved to 9.4 per cent while market capitalisation increased by N149.4 billion to N15.141 trillion. Friday’s session saw the ASI up by 0.91 per cent closing the week at 29,618.52 points while market capitalisation closed at N15.256 trillion. Reacting to the development in the market, analysts who spoke to Sunday Sun, were of the opinion that equities would continue to see strong runs, but advised investors to cherry-pick on stocks with sound fundamentals. Head, Research, FSL Securities, Victor Chiazor, expressed optimism that the market would do well with investors waiting on dividends by different companies quoted on the NSE. Chiazor said: “We have had more of positive runs than the negative ones and it shows you that investors are clearly looking at our market and the reasons are not far fetched. If you look at our macroeconomic space, things are looking up and let us not forget this is not an election year unlike last year. “This is a different scenario as we are having oil prices above our budget benchmark, we are in a year end season where companies will be declaring their full year results and we expect dividend, the fixed income and money market space where we have yields playing around five-six per cent whereas you have companies that are giving you dividend yield of about eight-12 per cent, so with all indications, it looks like the market might not be where it ought to be, but beyond doubt in the medium to long term, more funds will come towards the equities space”.
Also speaking, Chief Executive Officer, Highcap Securities, David Adnori, said that although the market has started on a positive note, policies need to be put in place to sustain the run. He also advised investors to continue to visit their stockbrokers to be aware of what stocks to buy as well as sell. “Yes the market has started the year on a positive note and hopefully it will be sustained. However, we need policies in place to sustain that run so that what happened last year will not happen again”.
