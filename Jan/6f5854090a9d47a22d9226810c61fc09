 The modern-day man/woman is now more than ever interested and almost obsessed with not just looking good but also feeling as good as they look. Young millennials not only care about their physical appearance but they are also constantly seeking for ways to improve their sexual knowledge. They are as keen as ever in being both healthy and fit too, not only physically, psychologically or mentally but also sexually too.  “Couples these days take their sexual wellness as seriously as they take their physical appearance too. Every couple wants a relationship that will thrive in all aspects both outside the bedroom and inside it too.” says Deborah Erioluwapo founder and CEO of Omoshola’s Empire. She says most men and women are no longer content with just sex as a relationship or marital duty that isn’t meant to be enjoyed or savoured, and are now looking for ways to spice up the intimacy between them and heighten the pleasure they derive from being sexually active. She says at Omoshola’s Empire they offer all round wellness services to help you look and feel your best. A place where clients can find the help or assistance they require to improve their relationships without feeling embarrassed or any inhibitions. She said her aim in founding Omoshola’s Empire is to help customers experience and enjoy the benefits of total sexual wellness and massage therapy which includes but is not limited to improved libido and circulation, increased immune efficiency, heightened intimacy pleasure and more. Appointments for consultations and treatments can be scheduled online on the website or by calling the dedicated customer lines or contacting them via direct messaging on any of their social media pages. Walk in customers are also welcome at their offline offices. She said at OMOSHOLA’S PLACE her goal is to ensure every relationship enjoys the full benefits of intimacy, physical fitness as well as a healthy sexual lifestyle.
