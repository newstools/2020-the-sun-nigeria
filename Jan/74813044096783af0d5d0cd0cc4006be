A Palestinian teenager was on Thursday shot by Israeli soldiers as he allegedly attempted to carry out a stabbing attack in the West Bank, the Israeli army said. The incident took place at the Gush Etzion Junction, a crossroad in a major settlement bloc in South of the West Bank city of Ramallah. The Israeli army said the suspect tried to stab Israeli soldiers at a bus stop, but was however, neutralized. Israeli media reported that the suspect, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy, sustained light-to-medium wounds, and was arrested and taken to a Jerusalem hospital for treatment. Palestinians have carried occasional lone-wolf attacks since 2015. At least 60 Israelis have been killed in these stabbing, shooting, and car-ramming attacks over the past four years. Israeli forces have killed at least 260 Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem over the same time period.(Xinhua/NAN)
