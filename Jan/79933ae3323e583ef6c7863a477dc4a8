Federal Road Safety Corps boss, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, has decried the continuous carriage of containers by flat-bed trailers without proper latching on the highways and ordered immediate impoundment of such vehicles by patrol teams anytime they are sighted. As part of the efforts to get such dangerous trailers off the road, the corps is partnering with the Nigerian Ports Authority to ensure that the vehicles are not allowed to leave the ports in the first instance unless their containers are latched and other maximum safety standards observed. This was contained in a press statement by the Corps Pubic Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem. Speaking on the dangers of such to other road users, Oyeyemi said that apart from the threatto lives and properties, these containers when they fall on the highways or any part of the road; can easily lead to unnecessary road obstruction that will cause undue hardship to motorists who will have much of their traveling time wasted on the road before the obstruction is cleared. So, in order to avert this and put a stop to further recurrence, the Corps Marshal has directed the Operatives of the Corps to be on red alert and impound at sight, any of such trailers found in the act. He also revealed that the Corps will achieve this in friendly collaboration with other law enforcement agencies. He also beckoned on the public to take advantage of the National Traffic Radio 107.1 FM or the toll free 122 numbers to report any of such trailers seen on the highways without proper latching of containers. He gave the National Traffic Radio numbers to call at all times as 090670000
