Gyang Bere, Jos A 26-year-old medical aid worker working with Alliance For International Medical Action, Jennifer Ukambong Samuel who regained freedom from the Boko Haram captivity said she didn’t meet with Leah Sharibu but she was told that Leah was doing well. Jennifer, who arrived Jos on Saturday amidst crowds after the Department of State Services facilitated her release told our correspondent in Jos that they were not allowed to see other abducted girls but said they met with Alice, a lady who has been in captivity for long told her that Leah is doing fine. “I don’t know how many of us that were taken but I think we were eight or nine in number. We started moving inside the bush and got to a place were they wanted to make video recording for us to speak to Federal Government. “They said we should tell Federal Government that if they want us to be release, they should release their people in government custody. When we got there, I saw Alice; the last day we were going, she was the only person we were allowed to see. “I didn’t see Leah Sharibu but Alice said Leah and Grace were doing fine, that is what she told me.That if I had known her before she was abducted, I would have agree that she is doing fine; she is very fat but she wasn’t fat before her abduction.” Jennifer said they were kept in a tick bush for about three weeks and said the insurgents gave them food and urged them to request whatever they want for their comfort. She noted that they were not harassed sexually but they were preparing them for the action when one of them said their religion permits them to have sex with their slaves. Jennifer appreciated the Department of State Services, other security agencies, the Federal Government and spirited individuals who cried out for their release.
