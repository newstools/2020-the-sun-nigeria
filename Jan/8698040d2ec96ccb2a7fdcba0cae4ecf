Godwin Tsa, Abuja The High Court of the Federal Capital  Territory (FCT) Abuja, on Friday, reaffirmed its earlier order sacking Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Peoples Party(YPP) as the senator representing Anambra South. In his ruling, Justice Bello Kawu refused to grant Ubah’s request to set aside the earlier order issued in a judgment delivered by the court on April 11, 2019. The judge had, in the April 11  judgment, sacked Ubah for allegedly submitting a forged National Examination Council certificate to contest the February 23, 2019, senatorial election. He directed that a fresh one be issued to Dr Obinna Uzoh of the Peoples Democratic Party, who came second at the election. The suit marked CV/3044/2018 was filed before the court by a registered voter in Anambra State, Mr Anani Chuka. In his bid to vacate the initial order, Ubah had subsequently filed an application before the court praying for an order setting aside the judgment on the grounds that occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice against him. Justice Kawu had on December 4, 2019,  granted an order of stay of execution restraining the Senate President from swearing-in Uzoh, pending the hearing and determination of Ubah’s application. The judge also ordered all parties to the suit including the INEC to maintain status quo in the meantime. But ruling on Friday, the judge dismissed the application for lacking in merit.
