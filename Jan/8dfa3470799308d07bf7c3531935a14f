You can see that it is a new development, a cheaper way of building houses and what we can only do is to encourage them to do more.” He added that the state government is thinking of using the technology used for the bungalow construction of the Idale housing units to two or three floors, because it is cheaper, quicker and very clean. According to him, “it is something that we are very proud to be associated with and we are also happy that this is the first Joint Venture (JV) that this administration will be delivering. Moving forward, we can only continue to do more, we cannot stop at this stage.” On collaboration with Echostone to reduce housing shortfall in Lagos, the Commissioner said: “We can see that they are capable, and they know what they are doing. And we are happy with this collaboration. We can only look out to improve on what we have presently. And that is why I said that we are thinking of using the technology to grow to about two-three floors, to enable more people benefit.” Considering the quality of materials used in construction, he said: “ The quality of materials used here is something that is commendable, we are happy with what we are seeing here, and we are proud to be associated with Echostone Nigeria.” Also speaking,  Special Adviser to the Governor on Tourism, Art and Culture, Lagos State, Bonu Solomon Saanu, said, “This is a fantastic project and I’m highly impressed with what I’m seeing here. Commenting on the level of innovation and technology put into use, he noted: “If you look at the level of technology used in building these structures, as you can see, there was no single block.

This development is very nice.” Commenting on how Idale housing projected powered by Echostone Nigeria will impact the housing deficit in the state, the SA added, “By the time this over 200 blocks are being put into use, it will surely go a long way to reduce the housing deficit in Lagos. He, therefore, commended the initiator of the project, Echostone Nigeria for the job well done. He, however, encouraged them to do more in Lagos, adding that the state government is available to strengthen its partnership with the company for better development. On his part, the representative of the Permanent Secretary, Housing, Mr. Olu Atitebi, pointed out that the initiative and the technology being applied with the cost would provide fair affordability to the people of Lagos towards having their own homes. “So, the idea has been well-conceived and implemented towards bringing comfort to the citizenry”, he said. Meanwhile, the Director of EchoStone Nigeria, Mr Sammy Adigun, reiterated that his firm would meet the housing needs of Lagos residents, with the support of all the relevant stakeholders, without compromising quality. It is, however, worthy of note that EchoStone takes only 14 days to build each home, and it is IFC/EDGE certified green homes with high quality, well furnished two bedrooms and two bathroom homes with a full complement of world-class infrastructure.
