Obiano gave the commendation during the inauguration and handing over of Umunze Erosion/Flood Control and Road Improvement Works saying the project was  approved by President Buhari. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Dr. Nkem Okeke, said that the President’s intervention had made it possible to tackle the menace of erosion and the  havoc wreaked on communities in the state.
