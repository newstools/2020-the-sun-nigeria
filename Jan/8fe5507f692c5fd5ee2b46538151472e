As part of its corporate social responsibility and in the spirit of Christmas, TGI Distri has put smiles on faces of residents of Agege Community in the final of Terra Cares4naija campaign. The CSR initiative which commenced during the commemoration of the United Nations October 16, 2019 World Food Day, extended to Majidun in Ikorodu, Makoko, Iwaya, Ajegunle, Owode, Sari Iganmu, Oworonsoki and Ijora with the aim of feeding 10,000 Lagosians with nutritious food seasoned with Terra Cubes. Speaking during the Terra Cares4naija outreach at Agege community, the Media and Activation manager of TGI Distri, Mrs. Nnenna Onyeanacho, explained that the aim of the campaign was to connect with the people and put a smile on their faces with the show of love and care.  At the event Terracares4naija Santa Claus gave out various items including education materials to Agege residents. She said the Terracares4naija is all about nurturing a happier society with love, care and food. “While some talked about poverty, TGI Distri decided to put smiles on the faces of 10,000 deserving yet undernourished individuals in the last 10 weeks and in 10 communities.” Mrs. Onyeanacho stated that the initiative was as a way of giving back to the society and an integral part of its continued efforts to add value to lives, making life better and putting smiles on the faces of citizens. She said: “We care about the people and the community where we operate and that’s why we came up with this sustainable initiative. The overarching goal is to reach out to the deserving underprivileged Lagosians in 10 different locations to spread love, care, spend time with them and feed them”.
