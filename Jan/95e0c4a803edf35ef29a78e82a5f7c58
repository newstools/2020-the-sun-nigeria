Vincent Kalu The National President of Igbo Youth Movement, Eliot Ugochuwu Uko has warned that the country is living on borrowed time.

According to him, 2020 provides a wonderful opportunity for the leadership and political elite to rise up and do the needful urgently; to begin the process of reconstructing the polity in order to whittle down excess power from the centre and devolve same to the federating units via a new people’s constitution. He said: “ A partisan, respectable committee of eminent and patriotic leaders should be raised now to begin the process of a holistic restructuring of the polity. We have pretended for too long that this military decree 24 of 1999,a.k.a, 1999 constitution, can sustain, unite and grow Nigeria. “ We have lied to ourselves for much too long, consistently resisting the truth, in preference to falsehood, is a dangerous and unhelpful response to the stark reality facing us as a country.
