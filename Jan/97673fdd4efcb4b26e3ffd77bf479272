The bed frames for athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games will be made from recyclable cardboard. The mattresses for the beds will be formed of polyethylene materials that will be reused for plastic products after the events. There will be 18,000 beds needed for the Olympics, and 8,000 for the Paralympics. Medals for the Tokyo 2020 Games are made entirely from recycled consumer devices. The beds will be 2.10 metres long and the manufacturers say they will be able to support a weight of about 200kg, which is more than any athlete weighed at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. As part of plans to be more environmentally friendly, the Olympic torch is made from aluminium waste and the podiums from recycled household and marine plastic waste, while electricity will come from renewable sources.
