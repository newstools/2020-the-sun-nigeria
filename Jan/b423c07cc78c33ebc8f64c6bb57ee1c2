The MCI team is made up of a collection of superb young men and women who are deeply passionate about creating the next generation of journalists through offering knowledge and solutions-based skills. The team comes from varied backgrounds in the profession such as radio, television, communication, creative design, strategy, and research. In 2019, the group successfully collaborated with the Office of the Prime Minister of Uganda to train 1,000 young journalists on effective reporting on climate change in the 2019 Climate Change Media Challenge.  The event was held last November. On his part, Bestelink, who grew up in Botswana, is a producer, director and cinematographer who was reputed for filming the Nat Geo Wild Savage Kingdom series.
