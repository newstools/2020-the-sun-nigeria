Godwin Tsa, Abuja The High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, yesterday, reaffirmed its earlier order sacking Ifeanyi Ubah of the Young Peoples Party (YPP) as the senator representing Anambra South. In his ruling, Justice Bello Kawu, refused to grant Ubah’s request to set aside the earlier order issued in a judgment delivered by the court on April 11, 2019. The judge had, in the April 11 judgment, sacked Ubah for allegedly submitting a forged National Examination Council certificate to contest the February 23, 2019, senatorial election. The judge had ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission to withdraw the certificate of return issued to Ubah. He directed that a fresh one be issued to Dr. Obinna Uzoh of the Peoples Democratic Party, who came second in the election. The suit marked CV/3044/2018 was filed before the court by a registered voter in Anambra State, Mr. Anani Chuka. In his bid to vacate the initial order, Ubah had subsequently filed an application before the court praying for an order setting aside the judgment on the grounds that it occasioned a grave miscarriage of justice against him. He told the court that he was not served with the court processes or the hearing notice throughout the proceedings leading to the judgment. Justice Kawu had on December 4, 2019,  granted an order of stay of execution restraining the Senate President from swearing in Uzoh, pending the hearing and determination of Ubah’s application. The judge also ordered all parties to the suit including the INEC to maintain the status quo in the meantime. But ruling yesterday, the judge dismissed the application for lacking in merit. He also dismissed a motion another claimant to the PDP senatorial ticket, Chief Chris Uba, filed to be joined as an interested party in the substantive suit.
