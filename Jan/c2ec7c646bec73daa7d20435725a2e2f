Nigeria Professional Football League outfit, Enyimba have relieved Usman Abd’allah of his duties as head coach on Monday. His dismissal came in the wake of their 4-0 defeat to Plateau United in Sunday’s league outing in Jos and his assistant, Fatai Osho has been appointed to take charge in an interim role. Since their 1-0 win over Rivers United on December 12, Enyimba are winless in their last five games – losing three and settling for two draws.

Enyimba are placed 13th in the Nigeria Professional Football League table with 15 points after 10 games. They host Kwara United for their next fixture on Wednesday. “This is not a decision we have have taken lightly, nor in haste,” club chairman, Felix Anyansi Agwu noted. “Results and performances since the start of this season have been very unimpressive and the club must take action to forestall further setbacks.
