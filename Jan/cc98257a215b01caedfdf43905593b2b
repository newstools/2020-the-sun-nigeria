Mr Mojola said his team was at the market on January 19 to sensitise the traders to the need to ensure safety in the market to avoid fire outbreak, which led to loss of lives and valuable goods in 2019. On effort to prevent a repeat, Mr. Mojola said government and all relevant stakeholders including market leaders were already planning to introduce Safety Marshall in markets across the state. “We  had meeting with all the agencies and the local government chairmen on how we can collectively work together to prevent re-occurrence of urgly incident like this; what happened was human error. It is not something that should have happened but it has happened and we need to checkmate it. We will engage market leaders and market leaders will nominate people among them that we will train on safety measures,  we are going to train the nomimiee as safety marshall. They will also be whistle-blower on issues of safety in the market,” he said. He also disclosed that integrity test would be carried out on all buildings in the area and anyone that failed the test would be demolished.
