Novak Djokovic recorded a straight-sets victory over long-time rival Rafael Nadal on Sunday to keep Serbia’s hopes alive in the final of the inaugural ATP Cup team event in Sydney. Djokovic won 6-2 7-6(4), extending his dominance over the Spaniard on hard courts, a surface Nadal has not beaten him on since 2013. The tie will now be decided by a high-stakes doubles match, where the world’s two highest-ranked players will face off to determine the winner of the 15 million dollars event. Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut earlier completed a flawless tournament by defeating Serbia’s Dusan Lajovic 7-5 6-1.(Reuters/NAN)
