Reacting, Cordros Capital in their weekly note to Sunday Sun said: “Looking ahead, while we expect profit-taking to continue in the coming week, we still see significant legroom for a further rally as the elevated maturities from fixed income instruments hunt for investment vehicles. Nonetheless, we advise investors to cherry-pick fundamentally sound stocks”.

But this year has seen positive performances amidst mixed sentiments by investors. “There are expectations that by the end of 2020, the equities market will be one of the best performing market in the base case scenario and so I think with the time we will see the gains coming, especially as investors are awaiting the release of earnings’ result by quoted companies”.
