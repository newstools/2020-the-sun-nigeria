He attributed the fire incidents to mismanagement of electrical appliances, electricity surge, improper use of inflammable items and engagement of unqualified electricians. Bello also enjoined smokers to always ensure that cigarette butts were properly disposed, especially now that the harmattan season is in. According to him, the fire service currently have no functional vehicles for quick response to fire incidents and other emergencies. “The fire department is only managing two rickety, old trucks out of nine trucks of which seven are grounded,’’ Bello said.
