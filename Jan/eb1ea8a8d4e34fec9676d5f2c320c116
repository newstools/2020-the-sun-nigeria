 Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa There is anxiety in both camps of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as the Court of Appeal is set to deliver ruling on the disputed September 4 APC governorship primaries. The governor-elect, Chief David Lyon who was declared the winner of the governorship primary and the November 16 election is being challenged by former Minister of State Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri who claimed  he is the authentic winner of the governorship primaries. Justice Jane Inyang who ruled over the case brought by Lokpobiri at the Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa had thrown a spanner into the works of the APC, saying that neither Lyon nor Lokpobiri is the candidate of the party as the party did not conduct a valid governorship primary election. Both parties had filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal Port Harcourt  while the PDP which is hoping to profit from any judicial pronouncement against the APC also filed a cross-appeal. The three-man panel of Court of Appeal justices had heard the appeal on Wednesday January 8 and adjourned indefinitely for judgement. In a notice sent to parties on Friday, the court fixed 10am on Saturday to deliver judgement on the three appeals before it. The notice read in part “ the three appeals with Appeal NOS : CA/PH/575/2019, CA/PH/585/2019 and CA/PH/586/2019(All against the decision of the Federal High Court Yenagoa delivered on Thursday 14th November 2019 ) comes up at the Court of Appeal PH Division Saturday 11/01/2020 for judgement by 10 am.”
