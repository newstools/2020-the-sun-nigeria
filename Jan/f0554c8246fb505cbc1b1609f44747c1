Joe Apu Leicester City Manager, Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Nigerian international midfielder Wilfred Ndidi’s has undergone a successful knee surgery noting that ‘it went very well’. Though, he maintained during a press conference on Friday that the Nigeria international is still a number of weeks from returning to contention, he is glad the surgery was a success. “It went very well,” Rodgers told the national media on Friday, ahead of today’s Premier League visit of Southampton to King Power Stadium (3pm kick-off). “It was a good operation. He’s now back in and straight into his recovery. Something around that (three or four weeks). Sometimes it can be sooner, sometimes it can’t be.” Ndidi, 23, suffered a knee injury in training ahead of Wednesday’s Carabao Cup Semi-Final first leg tie against Aston Villa, and is expected to be out for around three or four weeks.
