Paris St-Germain (PSG) forward Kylian Mbappe’s ankle sprain injury will be reassessed in three days’ time, the Ligue 1 champions said on Saturday. Mbappe suffered an ankle sprain in Friday’s French Cup final win over St Etienne. A rough tackle from Loic Perrin saw the St Etienne defender catch Mbappe on the ankle and the 21-year-old collapsed on the pitch in pain before he was substituted. Perrin was sent off for the challenge as PSG won 1-0. “Serious right ankle sprain to the external lateral compartment. To be re-evaluated in 72 hours with clinical and ankle imaging analysis,” the club said of Mbappe’s injury in a statement. Mbappe returned to the bench on crutches after half-time. He later told French President Emmanuel Macron during the trophy ceremony that he heard a crack when he was tackled but did not think he had broken his ankle. Ligue 1 champions PSG did not say if Mbappe will feature in Friday’s French League Cup final against Olympique Lyonnais. The Parisians are chasing a quadruple of titles this season. They also face Italian side Atalanta in a UEFA Champions League quarter-final single leg knockout game in Lisbon on Aug. 12.(Reuters/NAN)
