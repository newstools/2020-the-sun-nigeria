Mike Tyson believes Deontay Wilder needs to ‘grow up’ if he is going to beat Tyson Fury in their second rematch. Wilder and Fury’s first fight ended in a draw before they fought again in Las Vegas in February where the British heavyweight came out victorious. Their trilogy fight is due to happen in December and when Tyson was pressed on whether he expected another walk over from Fury, Tyson replied during an Instagram chat with rapper Fat Joe: ‘No there’s always a chance. Everyone always has a chance. ‘It just depends on how much they want to give in to it. If he wants to dedicate his life to really winning this fight, anything can happen. ‘Wilder can still make a lot of money. He shouldn’t feel sad or discouraged. He should continue to go out there and fight with a lot of zest and confidence. ‘He’s feeling like he’s given up, ‘Oh my life is over, I made £72million so far but my life is over, oh lord, oh God, I wanna die’. ‘Grow up man, let’s just keep going through this until it’s really over.’ Fury’s trilogy fight against Wilder could be held in the brand new state-of-the-art Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The final details are still to be confirmed but December 19 is the targeted date and the NFL venue has been touted as an option to play host.
