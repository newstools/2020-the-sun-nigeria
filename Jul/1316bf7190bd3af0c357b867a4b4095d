IGP who stated this in Ukpo community, Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State during the opening ceremony of the new Zone 13 was represented by the Deputy Inspector General of Police [DIG], Celestine Okoye, who is in charge of the ICT in Force Headquarters, Abuja.

Earlier in his speech, the pioneer boss of the new zone, Danmallam Mohammed, an Assistant Inspector General of Police [AIG], pledged to do everything within his powers to drain the zone of all criminal elements.
