According to him, also discussed at the meeting which was attended by the party chairmen of the six States in the Southwest and other members of the APC caucus in the zone, included the need to strategically position the zone ahead of the party’s national convention expected to hold after the Edo and Ondo governorship elections respectively. Oyetola maintained that part of the strategies was to reach out to all the aggrieved members of the party in all the States of the Southwest, to appeal to them to put the party’s interests above their respective personal interests for the party to progress. The governor said, “We had a successful deliberation on various issues. First of all was the opportunity the meeting afforded us to fully brief members on the matters on the agenda of the national caretaker committee of the party, of which I’m the representative of the Southwest zone. “The briefing is necessary to enable us to reposition the Southwest strategically ahead of the national convention to hold in six months’ time. “We also discussed the need to immediately reach out to members that are aggrieved for necessary reconciliation and ensure victory of our party in the coming governorship election in Ondo.
