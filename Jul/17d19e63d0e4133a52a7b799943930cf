Hard work, honesty and commitment in any human endeavour surely have rewards. For Sesan Adeniye, business mogul and former financial secretary of Auto Spare Parts and Machine Dealers Association (ASPAMDA), these are virtues he grew up with. As one of the founding fathers of ASPAMDA, he knows the story of the association like the back of his palms. Today, Adeniye is credited with being the most successful financial secretary in the history of ASPAMDA, an association that has grown in leaps and bounds. Now, as the election of the association is fast approaching, many members are pitching their tents with him to become the next president. Already, the ambition of the Ogun State-born businessman is enjoying massive support from major interest groups within the system. On his part, Adeniye has promised to raise the bar of leadership, capacity building, while assisting small businesses to obtain loans from financial institutions. He also promised mutually rewarding partnership with foreign business associates and other stakeholders, with special attention on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, among others. Surely, the sky is the limit for this enterprising young man fondly called Ezejinka.
