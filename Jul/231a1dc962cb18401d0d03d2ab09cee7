The elections were billed to hold on Monday and Tuesday in Awka Obinna Dike, the Head of the Media and Publicity Sub-committee, announced the postponement in a statement on Sunday night in Awka. He said the postponement was sequel to the letter from Anambra government which directed that the elections be shelved as it violated the extant law on COVID-19 protocols. Dike added that the committee was awaiting further directives. “The Electoral Committee has forwarded the said letter to the Anambra State Football Association. “In view of this development, the Electoral Committee wishes to inform the general public that the election earlier fixed for July 27 and July 28 will no longer hold as scheduled. ”We regret any inconvenience this sudden postponement may caused to the candidates, delegates, observers, stakeholders and the general public,” the statement said in part.
