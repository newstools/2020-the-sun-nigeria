The video conferencing was coordinated by the President of Niger and current Chairperson of the Authority, Mahamadou Isso-Ufou. The document released after the summit read by Dada and signed by President Isso-Ufou, explained the role of the unity government. “The main task of this National Unity Government will be to deal with the consequences of the demonstrations, and  implement all reforms and recommendations issued from the Inclusive National Dialogue and to improve governance.
