The Acting Chairman of the Ondo State chapter of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr Dele Thomas, has pleaded with the Inspector-General of Police to instruct the state commissioner of police to seal up the party secretariat in the state. Thomas made the plea in a statement issued in Akure on Monday, explaining that closing down the secretariat would prevent political violence. Thomas also urged the police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to investigate certain factional members of the party that had been arrogating leadership of the party to themselves after their tenure had elapsed. He also alleged that some factional members of the dissolved National Working Committee of the party had decided to parade themselves as leaders. Thomas noted that any gubernatorial candidate willing to contest on the platform of the SDP platform in October 10 gubernatorial election should be very careful as who to deal with to avoid pre-election litigation in court.(NAN)
