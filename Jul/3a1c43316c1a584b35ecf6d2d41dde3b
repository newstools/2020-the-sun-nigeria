Spokesman of IYC, Ebilade Ekerefe, at a press conference  after the meeting disclosed that part of the solution to the ongoing recriminations between the NDDC and the National Assembly could be found in the strict implementation of the original master plan for the development of the Niger Delta region The group, therefore, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, appoint a substantive Coordinator for the Presidential Amnesty Programme (PAP) and as well commence  the implementation of the remaining legs of the programme.
