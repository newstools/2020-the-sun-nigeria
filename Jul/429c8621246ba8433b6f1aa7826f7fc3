Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has named the railway complex in Agbor, Delta State, after former President Goodluck Jonathan. According to a Presidential Aide, Tolu Ogunlesi, via his verified twitter handle @toluogunlesi, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, announced this yesterday. He tweeted: “Breaking, President @MBuhari has approved the naming of the Railway Complex in Agbor – the operational hub of #ItakpeWarriRail Line – after former President @GEJonathan. It will be known as the Goodluck Jonathan Railway Station & Complex — Minister of Transport, @ChibuikeAmaechi. The railway complex in Agbor is the centre of operation, which connects the Itakpe-Warri rail line. It is joined by Benin to Onitsha rail, among other segments of the country. The rail line is part of the Lagos-Calabar coastal railway project, which cuts across most states in the Southeast and South-south. The project implemented by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) was initiated during Jonathan’s administration. Amaechi had in 2016 signed a fresh mandate to commence construction of the project.
