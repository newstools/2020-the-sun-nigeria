The Governor who restated the resolve of his administration to make life unbearable for criminals, called on people of the State to always provide timely and useful information that could help security agents combat kidnapping, cultism and other crimes in the state. The Governor made the call while briefing newsmen after the State Security Council meeting he presided over, at the Government House in Makurdi on Tuesday. Ortom noted that intelligence gathering remains key to the war against criminals even as he vowed that criminal elements operating in the state must be decimated. Governor Ortom commended security operatives in the state for their proactive and gallant efforts in ensuring peace in the state. He also commended some of the newly sworn-in Council Chairmen for the measures they are taking in tackling insecurity in their domains, urging them to sustain the tempo. Governor Orton said council also took far reaching decisions to end the pockets of land disputes involving some communities which have agreed to give peace a chance. He said the security of lives and property would continue to be a priority of his administration, pointing out that without peace, there would be no meaningful development in the society.
