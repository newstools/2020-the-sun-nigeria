 Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has confirmed Jude Idimogu, represent­ing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency 2 at the Lagos State House of Assembly, as the Apex Igbo leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Sanwo-Olu, who unveiled Idimogu at a crucial meet­ing with members of the House of Assembly, including the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, on Sunday night at State House, Marina, by his action laid to rest the issue of who is the true Apex Igbo leader of APC in the state. While emphasising the need to put records straight, Sanwo-Olu stated that his Chief of Staff (CoS) would henceforth deal with Idi­mogu on matters relating to Ndigbo in the state. Sanwo-Olu said: “My Chief of Staff will deal with Idimogu as the new apex leader of Ndigbo in APC. We have heard of the efforts he has made so far in bringing his people clos­er to the party. We appreci­ate his contributions and would relate with him and Ndigbo cordially to make Lagos great for all of us.” Idimogu, in his reaction, commended Sanwo-Olu and his colleagues at the House of Assembly for the honour done to him and Ndigbo in Lagos. He maintained that he had enjoyed tremendous support and cooperation from the Speaker since he was elected into the House in 2015. The lawmaker told his supporters that with his emergence as the apex Igbo leader, the coast had become clear for more work, stressing that it was not yet Uhuru as every Igbo man in Lagos must be ready to support APC and remain politically-relevant through active participation in the party’s affairs. “You cannot improve your welfare by remaining on the fence. You must reg­ister and become card-car­rying members of our great party. APC is the only party that will allow your voice to be heard in Lagos and you must take advantage of the support we are getting from the leaders of the party. “Let them know that we are here to make a difference. We must change the narrative of party politics from today,” Idimogu said.
