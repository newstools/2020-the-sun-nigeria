Property tycoon and CEO, Sujimoto Construction Company, Sijibomi Ogundele, has never stopped proving his critics wrong.
Only five years into the luxury property business, Ogundele, fondly called Sujimoto, is already playing in the big league. His first major project, Guilano by Sujimoto; followed immediately by Lucreza By Sujimoto, were all sold-out even before completion.
To satisfy his teeming customers who crave affordable luxury apartments with easy payment plans, Sujimoto has rolled out a new project, located at highbrow Banana Island, Lagos.
Speaking on the project, Sujimoto said it would be one of the biggest condominium apartments to grace the skyline of Lagos. Described as the most affluent neighbourhood in Africa, Banana Island houses the creme of Nigeria’s ultra-wealthy, making it the most expensive per square metre property in the continent. For instance, a 1,000sq metre land in Banana Island costs between N600 million to N750 million – the same size of land costs much more less immediately you step out of Banana Island, which is home to the super rich like the Adenugas, Dantatas, Rabius etc.
“The Leonardo project will offer clients a rare opportunity to enjoy exceptional features such as private IMAX cinema; indoor virtual golf offering residents over 2,500 golf courses in the world; Creche; designer kitchen by Kohler; interactive lobby with waiting area; full home automation that allows you to control your door; curtain, music, light and TV from the touch of a button. Other benefits include indoor salon, club house, mini-mart, state-of-the-art tech gym, infinity swimming pool, and tennis, squash and badminton courts; all of these without breaking the bank,” he explained.
