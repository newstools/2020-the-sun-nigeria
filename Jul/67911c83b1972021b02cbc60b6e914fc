Henry Akubuiro Fans of the award winning Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and booklovers worldwide will be savouring another offering from her this July. Entitled We Should All Be Feminists: The Desk Diary, the book will be published by Fourth Estate, a HarperCollins imprint.  It is an illustrated weekly planner, which contains some of Adichie’s most powerful and inspiring quotes, as well as an exclusive introductory essay.
