We need your help. We want to go back to our father’s land. We want to come home. Please, everybody should plead with those in authority on our behalf to assist us because we want to come home. We don’t want to die here,” she said. The girls specifically appealed to President Buhari, Femi Otedola, Senator Ademola Adeleke, Hon. Ladi Adebutu, Pastors TB Joshua, Enoch Adeboye and David Oyedepo, as well as Apostle Johnson Suleiman, Prophet Ajayi and Abike Dabiri among other well meaning Nigerians to come to their aid as a matter of urgency. When contacted through the phone, the spokesperson for the girls, the Osun State-born Adebisi said most of them were taken to Lebanon through agents, after they parted with monies ranging from N150,000 to N600,000. “Most of us were promised office work while others were promised that they would work as house help. However, most of their promises were fake. “Most of our sisters here are very sick and the Lebanese hospitals cannot treat them without their passports. Our madams seized our passports, which we processed with our own money. They even seized the property we brought from Nigeria like clothes and phones. “Many of us have worked for seven to nine months without salary. Most of us have developed ulcers due to starvation. Please help us, we want to go home as soon as possible. Our parents are in panic and greatly distressed; they are undergoing so much pains because they don’t know our fate,” she lamented.
