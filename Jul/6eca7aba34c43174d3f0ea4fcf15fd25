Your first committee was time-bound. And this one is without any limited time,’ he stated. The governor further explained that ‘crime, being a continuous process, your work should also be a continuous process. Because we want to be rest assured that this report will not be dumped. It is part of the major reasons why we are revolving you for this assignment.’ The judicial commission of inquiry had been inaugurated on October 31, 2019. The commission was given four weeks to critically look into the cases of missing persons in the state with a view to unravelling the circumstances leading to the crime.
