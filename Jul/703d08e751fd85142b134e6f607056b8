I have decided to do this for the generality of Ekiti people and to reassure everyone that I am okay. “I have basically isolated myself , which is the protocol , but only see my doctor. I want to tell our people that COVID-19 is real , if there are people out there who still think there is nothing like that, it is real. ” So, it is important you wear your face masks, wash your hands regularly and maintain social distancing at every opportunity and keep to yourself, that is the least we can do. ” We can  only care, it is God who heals. I thank our people for their solidarity and effusive messages of prayers that  I have received across Ekiti , Nigeria and even from outside Nigeria. ” I shall come out of this health challenge and  be physically back to  duty to render services to Ekiti.
