Tennis World No.1, Novak Djokovic and his wife, Jelena, have both tested negative for coronavirus, the player’s media team said yesterday. Djokovic was the fourth player to test positive after participating in his Adria Tour which ended up producing a cluster of coronavirus cases. “Novak Djokovic and his wife Jelena are negative for COVID-19. That was shown by the results of the PCR tests that both had in Belgrade,” said the statement. The statement says both had no symptoms and that they were in self-isolation in the Serbian capital since testing positive 10 days ago. Djokovic has been under fire in recent days due to the lack of social distancing norms followed during the Adria Tour. He has, however, found support from Serbian athletes and even the Serbian Prime Minister, Ana Brnabic. “Every part of him. He tried to do something good for the whole region,” Brnabic said in an interview with PinkTV.
