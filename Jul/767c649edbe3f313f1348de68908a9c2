Speaking on the financial performance, the Managing Director, NSIA, Mr Uche Orji, said that the outlook for the Fund remains promising. He said,  “The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented human and health crisis with significant impact on global markets. As such, it may be difficult to predict the markets overall reaction to development. “It is predictable that the volatility introduce by the onset of the pandemic may linger. However, the Authority continues to monitor the market conditions with the view to leverage the upside risks that avail themselves in the market. “We expect that our investment strategy will continue to deliver positive returns in the long term in 2020 as the markets normalize and new opportunities emerge.” The NSIA boss said asset allocation strategy remains stable across the various funds adding that future generations fund remains 25 per cent public equity, 25 per cent private equity, 25 per cent absolute returns and 25 per cent other diversifiers.
