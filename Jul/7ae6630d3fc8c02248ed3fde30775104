He said the NWC had called on all our leaders, members and supporters in Jigawa state and the nation at large to disregard the purported caretaker committees as they do not have the mandate and approval of our party at any level. In earlier statement signed by the PDP national publicity secretary Kola Ologbondiyan declared that the NWC hereby directs the North West Zonal Working Committee of our great party, to immediately take charge and supervise the activities of the Jigawa state Caretaker Committee. The NWC assures all members of our party in Jigawa and urged them to remain calm and continue to work with the North West Zonal Working Committee as it coordinates the activities of the Jigawa State Caretaker Committee. ‎
