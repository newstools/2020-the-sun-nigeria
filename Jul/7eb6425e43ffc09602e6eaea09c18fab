The decapitated and dismembered body of a self-made millionaire and the CEO of Gokada has been found in his luxury Manhattan apartment by his heartbroken sister, and the police are now in search for killers. The police say they found the corpse of Fahim Saleh, the 33-year-old Gonads Chief Executive, cut to pieces  with an electric saw by a suspect who may have followed him into his apartment from the elevator. The victim has been identified as Fahim Saleh, a millionaire tech entrepreneur who moved into his $2.25 million Lower East Side apartment late last year. The alarm was raised by one of Saleh’s siblings on Tuesday, after she became concerned because she had not heard from him for a day. She went to the seventh floor unit to check on her brother and found his dismembered body in his home. He had been cut up with a power saw, which was lying nearby and was still plugged in. Police sources said the body parts had been sorted into different plastic bags. Source: Daily Mail Uk
