PAUL EREWUBA  Mike Tyson is ready to make his fighting comeback, although it will not be inside a boxing ring this time, it was gathered. According to Discovery Channel, the former two-time heavyweight champion will take on a Great White shark as part of ‘Shark Week’. The fight, dubbed ‘Tyson vs Jaws: Rumble on the Reef,’ will take place on August 9. Iconic ring announcer, Michael Buffer, is also set to be involved in proceedings on what promises to be a truly remarkable spectacle. “With famed ring announcer Michael Buffer calling the shots, these two heavyweights will square off underwater, where Mike Tyson will try to score a TKO over the massive shark … all in the name of research,” Discovery explained. Tyson announced earlier this year that he was planning to make his boxing return. The 54-year-old has been showing off his impressive physique in recent months, as he attempts to get into fighting shape. However, Tyson has admitted that he is apprehensive about fighting again.
