The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency Kogi State command Thursday made a major breakthrough as it intercepted substances suspected to be cocaine and other hard drugs being suspectedly ferried to insurgents terrorising the country in the North East. It was learnt that the Eagles -eyed operatives of the  command  made  the four different interceptions  and seizures in one day beat  all the concealment tactics of the hardened Couriers  of the drugs and their drivers. Parading the suspects before newsmen, the state Commandant of NDLEA, Mr Alfred Adewumi  said  within  a space of about five hours his men on a motorised patrol  along Abuja- Lokoja highway were able to intercept and  seized the illicit drugs  including cocaine and cannabis sativa  all of which weighed  about 1,120.36 kg The NDLEA boss  who took much time to dismantle  the cleverly concealed drugs before newsmen ,  said some of them  were packaged inside charcoal sacks  at the  back  of an open articulated vehicle while some were neatly  concealed inside grains and  unsuspected areas inside the vehicles. He said one the articulated vehicles in attempt to run away   hit and damaged one of the patrol vehicles and injured some of the  operatives while another a blue Nissan car fled into the bush and abandoned the car after a hot chase. While expressing displeasure over the rate of trafficking illicit drugs in the state, he said between January and June this year , a total of 7,500 kg of assorted drugs  were intercepted  by his command and raised concerns that most of these illicit drugs may find their way to insurgents terrorising the country in the North East. The NDLEA boss while appealing to members of the public to give useful information that can lead to arrest of those dealing in illicit drugs in the State,  said his command was more ready to put an end to  use  of illicit drugs in the state and to couriers passing through the state. He gave the names of suspects  and the drivers arrested  for cannabis sativa as  Murtala Mohammed,
Mohammed Bashir,
Mohammed Sani,
Ukasha Musa,
Abba Mukhtar. While the name of the person arrested with  Cocaine  is withheld for further investigation Speaking with newsmen one of the suspect’s, Mohamed Bashir who said he  was selling the drugs in one of the  states in the North East  confessed of committing the crime and pleaded for leniency.
