As gathered, the hullabaloo began after the demise of the immediate past Chief Imam of Apomu. The next in rank to the deceased religious leader, according to sources, that was supposed to take over was not allowed, as a powerful group with the Muslim community in the town rose against the next-in-rank and threw their wait behind another person, who is also in the chieftaincy line of the Chief Imam.  But in a telephone interview with journalists in Ibadan, Oba Adenekan-Afolabi, said kings in Yorubaland own mosques, therefore he has the right to select the right person to lead Muslims in his domain, adding that he had to dissolve all the activities of Alfas in Apomuland to avert bloodshed.
