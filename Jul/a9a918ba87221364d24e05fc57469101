The Managing Director of Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA), Prof Adesoji Adesugba, has warned officials of the agency against violations of  financial regulations and inappropriate financial dealings. Speaking while briefing the audit personnel of the agency, Adesugba declared that he would not tolerate tampering with financial regulations and corruptive activities, both in the procurement process and in the financial management of the agency. “Let me make this very clear- I will strictly enforce extant rules and financial regulations. I will not tolerate breaching of due process in procurement and other financial transactions. “I charge you to ensure proper records keeping and observance of the internal processes. Every transaction must be within the bound of the law. If there is any infraction, I will act swiftly against culprits. There must be no excuse. “I am a stickler for transparency and accountability. Any official who breached the financial protocols will be sanctioned. We will conduct governance audit to ensure the right things are done. We must adopt and follow our processes within the ground of extant regulations”, he declared. He urged the staff of the agency to imbibe the culture of transparency and accountability, warning that he will not shield nor defend any official engaging in corrupt practices. Adesugba  assumed duty as NEPZA boss on July 1, after President Muhammadu Buhari approved his appointment on June 26.
