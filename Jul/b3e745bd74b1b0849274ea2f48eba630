Bunmi Ogunyale KELECHI Iheanacho’s goal against Championship side, Brentford, in FA Cup has been nominated for Leicester City’s Goal of the Season. Iheanacho scored the only goal of the game after just four minutes when he tapped in to send the Foxes into the FA Cup fourth round. The Nigerian will slug it out with Jamie Vardy, James Maddison, Ricardo Pereira, Ayose Perez, Hamza Choud hury and Ben Chilwell for the award. Last season’s ceremony at King Power Stadium saw Ricardo Pereira scoop the Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season awards on a memorable evening, and after another fantastic season for the team, there’s plenty of competition for this year’s honours. Other categories to jostle for are the Supporters’ Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season.
