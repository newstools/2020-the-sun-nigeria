Abimbola said that the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic had compelled the court to restrict the number of people coming into the courtroom for the safety of not only the court users but to the court adjudicators. “What we did was to leave the court open during the COVID-19 lockdown and some judges including myself were sitting and giving different time forvparties to appear in court. “Lawyers were informed to come with very limited number of parties involved in a matter. “This reduced the number of litigants coming into the courtroom at any point in time. “Matters that are very urgent like motions, enforcement of fundamental human rights cases, bail of custody application were given attention during this period,” Abimbola said.(NAN)
