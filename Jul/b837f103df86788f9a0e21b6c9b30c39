Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly has confirmed Lille striker, Victor Osimhen called him to make an enquiry about racism in Italy ahead of a potential switch to the Stadio San Paolo outfit. The Super Eagle delivered impressive performances in his debut season with the Mastiffs which have seen a number of European clubs jostle for his signature. The forward scored 18 goals and provided six assists in 38 appearances to help Lille finish fourth in the French top-flight last season, and won the club’s player of the season for his displays. Napoli is leading in the race to sign the 21-year-old forward, but recently, his agent expressed his concern about racism in Italy. Koulibaly arrived at Stadio San Paolo in the summer of 2014 from Belgian club, Genk, and has developed into one of the best defenders in the world. The Senegal international, who has experienced racist abuse in the European country, revealed the advice he gave to Osimhen when he reached out to him. “It is true that he called me. We talked about racism, I told him that coming to Naples he won’t have these problems, he will choose the right city,” Koulibaly told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “I too felt the bitterness of the racist insult, but never in Naples. I reassured him, I told him that if he comes, he will have the best choice. Then, the rest will have to be done by the leaders.”
