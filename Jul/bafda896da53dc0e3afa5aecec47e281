Mike Ogbalu Being a good child to a dear parent, whom you share invaluable memories with all the time, it becomes obviously challenging and painful at the sudden loss of such a wonderful parent to find the right words to fully and adequately confer a warm tribute to such a personage, a rare gem and a trailblazer! Chief (Dr.) Micheal Mbanefo Nwabuonu Ogbalu (Ebubedike Abagana) was a quintessential gentleman, an accomplished community physician who devoted his entire lifetime to the service of the nation and humanity, particularly  in the development and management of the nation’s primary health care delivery system, as well as in the practice of community medicine in Nigeria. He was a Fellow of the West African College of Physicians, National Health Sector coordinator for Vision 20:2020 and a former executive director/CEO of National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA). He was also chairman/CEO, Ebubedike Health International Limited, and also founder and executive chairman of Coastal Health System Development Limited. Born to the famous Ogbalu family of Abagana on July 14, 1940, Dr. Ogbalu was happily married to Chief (Mrs.) Pauline Adaobi Ogbalu, from Eziowelle in Idemili LGA of Anambra State, a Nigerian/British-trained ophthalmic nurse who rose to become a senior nursing matron at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, and later became                                                                                                          the deputy head of the Department of Nursing Services at the famous National Hospital, Abuja. They have eight great children. Mike Ogbalu attended St. Paul’s Central School and St. Augustine’s Grammar School, Nkwerre, Imo State, and Dennis Memorial Grammar School, Onitsha, Anambra State, before gaining admission to the University of Ibadan in 1963 to study medicine. In 1967, the Nigeria/Biafra civil war broke out and young Ogbalu served as the refugee medical director for Nnewi, Awka-Etiti, Amechi, Ekwulobia and Nnobi, before joining the Biafran Army in 1968. He served as army medical doctor for the 21 Division and 5 Brigade, Military Representative for the Joint Hospital, Mbano, and public relations officer for the Armed Forces Hospital headquarters, Nkwerre.
