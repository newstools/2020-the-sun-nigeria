governorship candidate. Adewole, while speaking with newsmen after the election said the AA
would use all arsenals at its disposure to ensure that it wins the

as a result of maladministration and poor performances. Highlighting his programmes for the state if elected, Adewole promised
to generate over 10,000 jobs for the teeming youths within the first
year of his administration. He said he had already entered into agreement with some foreign
companies to invest in the state, stressing that “some foreign
investors had assured of their readiness to invest in the state as
soon as we get into power and this will ameliorate the sufferings of
the masses as there will be enough jobs in the state.” The governorship candidate also promised to invest into the education
and agricultural sectors by encouraging people to take interest in
farming through access to loans and provisions of agricultural
machinery. He enjoined the people of the state to support the AA in its desire to
end poor governance in the state and bring a new face to government.
