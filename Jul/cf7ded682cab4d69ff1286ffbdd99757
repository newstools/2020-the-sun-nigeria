The Federal Operations Unit (FoU), Zone A, of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) over the weekend intercepted contraband, and raised debit notes worth N17 billion on importers between January to June 2020. While contraband intercepted by the unit was from smugglers terrorising the South Western states of the country, it  includes items such as used vehicles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, foreign parboiled rice, tomato paste, second hand clothing among others. The debit notes were raised on importers who under-declared their cargoes for lesser Customs duty. Addressing newsmen, the Customs Area Controller of the unit, acting Comptoller Usman Yahaya, said N15.6 billion was generated from contraband seized from smugglers, while N1.4billion was raised from wrong classification, transfer of value and false declaration of cargoes. His words: “The total duty paid value of N15.6billion was premised on seized contraband while the N1.3billion was the revenue from the unit interventions arising from wrong classifications, transfer of value and false declarations by importers.
