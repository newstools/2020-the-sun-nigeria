The international future of the Hale End Academy product has been the subject of debate in recent months following the banner season he is having at the Gunners. Born in London, Saka qualifies to represent Nigeria through his parents, but England are ahead of their Nigerian counterparts in the race for his services, having played for the Young Lions U16, U17, U18 and U19 sides.
