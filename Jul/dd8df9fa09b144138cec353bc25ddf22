 BY PHILIP NWOSU Heavy explosion on Tuesday evening rocked the Ajao Estate area of Lagos, killing a mother and her child. Witnesses told sunnewsonline.com that the explosion occurred at about 6pm on Tuesday when the woman and her child were alleged to be attempting to refill a welding cylinder when the explosion occurred.  Several persons were injured, but a Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the injured have been evacuated to a hospital around the area. He declined to mention the hospital where they were evacuated to, but added that a tailor who has his shop near the gas shop was badly injured and also several passersby.  When sunnewsonline.com visited the area which was on a street identified as Inua Mohammed street, off Asa Afariogun street, we were able to count four vehicles which were destroyed and several shops also destroyed, The fire which was started as a result of the explosion were quickly put off by members of the Lagos state fire service and the LASEMA personnel , while the the mangled bodiesÂ  of the victims were still lying on the road. A witness who was identified as Kola Abayomi told sunnewsonline.com that the accident happened after a woman, who owned a cooking gas shop, and her daughter were called back on their way home to attend to a customer who had come to fill a gas cylinder. The witness said the woman and her daughter returned to the shop to attend to the customers because he was a regular customer. The shop owner it was learnt, was able to fill the gas without an accident. But trouble began when the customer wanted to load the already filled cylinder into a waiting tricycle and the cylinder fell off and exploded. That initial explosion set off a series of others, killing the shop owner and her daughter.
