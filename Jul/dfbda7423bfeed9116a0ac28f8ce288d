Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Government has, again, appealed to residents to isolate for 14  days  any visitor that comes into their homes, following the lifting of inter-state boundary travel and the resumption of domestic flights. Inter-ministerial Committee on COVID-19 Pandemic Chairman, Paulinus Nsirim, made the appeal when he appeared on a live radio programme in Port Harcourt. Nsirim, who is also the Commissioner for Information and Communications, advised those at airport and motor parks to ensure COVID-19 protocols are strictly adhered to. He said: “It is very obvious that the disease would likely be imported. And that is why it is a collective responsibility. Those who are working at the airport owe this nation a duty to ensure relevant protocols, at both entry and exit points, are fully observed. “And those multi-nationals and individuals, who would receive visitors or may be staff from those heavily impacted areas, owe the state that responsibility to ensure relevant protocol of 14 days isolation is adhered to,” he said. Nsirim also expressed regret that most religious organisations have failed to prevail on their members to observe the COVID-19 protocols. “The number 50 is for marriages and burials; churches 70  per service. But, of course, with the governor’s (Nyesom Wike) warning, it is very obvious that churches are flouting. And that is something that is worrisome. “I keep arguing that Christians need to be role models. Now, when Christians begin to flout government directives, I don’t think there is any hope for society. This is a clarion call to religious leaders. We shouldn’t sacrifice the lives of our members on the altar of church worship,” he said.
