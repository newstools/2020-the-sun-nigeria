Paul Osuyi, Asaba Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, and wife, Edith, on Wednesday tested positive for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The development is sequel to tests conducted on them after a few days of self-isolation, which they went into on Friday after one of their daughters tested positive to the virus. The two heads of the First Family in the state, according to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, are stable and have commenced necessary treatment, and further isolation. The governor thanked Deltans for their prayers for his family, and called for continued supplications for all patients undergoing treatment for the pandemic. He assured that his administration would not relent in its efforts at combating the virus in the state, and urged the public to support the government in that regard by complying with prescribed protocols by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Okowa reiterated that “COVID-19 is real. The rate is increasing in our state and the virus is taking the lives of some of our people. “I, therefore, again call on every Deltan to observe the protocols on the virus while in public, to curb further spread of the virus, especially in the communities.”
