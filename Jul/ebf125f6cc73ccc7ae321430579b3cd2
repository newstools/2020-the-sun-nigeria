Moshood Adebayo Executive Director of the World Health Organisation (WHO),  Health Emergencies Programme, Dr. Michael Ryan, has affirmed the readiness of organisation  to collaborate with bodies like The SCOAN to advance the cause of the war against the Coronavirus. The organisation spoke against the backdrop of a video of a medical doctor, who allegedly testified to receiving healing for COVID-19 after purportedly receiving prayers from a  Nigerian Pastor,  TB Joshua. During an interactive session last  Wednesday, a panel of top WHO officials was questioned on the miracle by a Cameroonian journalist.
