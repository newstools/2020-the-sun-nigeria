Magnus Eze, Enugu  Ebonyi State has given tax waiver to hawkers and petty traders in the state. Executive Chairman of the State Internal Revenue Service, Dr Austin Nweze, who disclosed this in a statement, said Governor David Umahi approved the reliefs in view of the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and in line with the Ebonyi State 2020 Revenue Law to help cushion the pains on this category of people.

The daily rate collectable from non-shop owners at the International Market is hereby waived until new accommodation is ready to enable them get shops. “Note that every Ebonyi citizen that earns an income must pay tax. However, those whose tax obligations are due within this pandemic period can seek renegotiation on their tax payments.”
