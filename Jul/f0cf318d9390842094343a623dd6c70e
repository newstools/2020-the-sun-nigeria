Mrs Nnena Akajemeli, the National Coordinator, SERVICOM rendered well deserved encomium on the CG for being a reform-minded public servant and Chief Executive. Akajemeli noted that the Comptroller General had shown interest in transforming the service and leading by example, a feat seen in the various infrastructural, administrative, operating systems and developments in the service.
