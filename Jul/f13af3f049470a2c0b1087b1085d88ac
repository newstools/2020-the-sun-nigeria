The lawmaker’s media aide, Olamilekan Olusada, said this in a statement in Ibadan. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that Akande-Sadipe, the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Diaspora, had after her election, launched the N25million scholarship scheme.

The lawmaker affirmed that the beneficiaries were selected on merit and each student was graded with a cumulative average of their academic standing as well as an entry essay. She disclosed that payments had been made into the beneficiaries’ bank account to cover the balance of their tuition fee and incidental expenses for the 2019/2020 academic year.
