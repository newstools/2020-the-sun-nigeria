The PDP leader,  while stating that members of the party will not be intimidated,  thanked the people of the state for their support for Governor Obaseki. “I think it is only very clear and there is no gainsaying about it that the APC must be called to order by the president himself and by the security agencies.  People are being intimidated, people are being shot at. “You know that when you have this frequent attacks, there is bound to be apathy, people ate bound to be frightened. Thus is not the first time it us coming up. “The PDP National Campaign Council however applauds the people of Edo state for their solidarity and support for our party and candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki, whose sterling achievements in office, personal conduct and respect for the sensibilities of the people of Edo state place him high and above other contenders.”
