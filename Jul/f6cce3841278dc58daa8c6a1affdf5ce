The statement read in part “Much accolades and appreciation go to the Senators who have kept this bill in focus and have followed through to this point. This huge effort by the Senators to sanitize the educational system is one that is highly recognized by well-meaning citizens and members of SOFADONDO (comprising Nigerian professionals and students from various backgrounds). SOFADONDO has been concerned about the increasing wave of Sex for Grades and Grades for Sex in tertiary institutions and its corresponding declining effects on educational standards. Aware of the challenges that sexual harassment has posed to our educational system and the products of our tertiary institutions, we urge President Muhammadu Buhari to give his assent to this bill by signing it into law. With SOFADONDO’s presence in several tertiary institutions across the country, we are ready to work with the government, like-minded organizations, individuals, and with the management of tertiary institutions to create the needed awareness to stop Sex for Grades and Grades for Sex.“
