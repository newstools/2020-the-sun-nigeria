 Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has criticized the government for the reversing its decision of reopening of school, as the this decision could trigger off a movement of Nigerians to Ghana to write the examination. Atiku spoke on the his verified twitter handle saying, “if this policy is not reversed, tens of thousands, and possibly hundreds of thousands of Nigerians, will breach social distancing rules to cross over to neighbouring West African nations to write their WASSCE, rather than miss a year.”
He explained there are thing that the Federal Government could do to ensure that the examination holds in Nigeria, pointing out that, “rather than cancellation, there are better ways to protect the health of Nigerians and prevent the pandemic from escalating. “We could mobilise all available public & private infrastructures, including primary schools, stadia, and cinemas, for the examinations. In the alternative, the Federal Government can prevail on WAEC to have staggered examinations with a different set of questions for each shift. “1.5 million Nigerian youths write the West African Senior School Certificate Examination annually. To abruptly cancel this examination is to set back our nation’s youth, and place them behind their contemporaries in other West African countries. “Already, Nigeria lags behind other African nations in crucial indices, like school enrolment, pass rates, and out of school children. This action will further create chaos in the public education system and exacerbate an already bad situation.”
