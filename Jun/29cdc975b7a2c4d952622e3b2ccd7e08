He made this known during the WIMBOARD Institute Webinar tagged: “The role of a Board in Anticipating and Managing Crisis”, held recently.  Speaking on what boards can do to anticipate crisis, Mitchell explained that a board takes a long-term view of the business and plans for seasons. Using the Interswitch Group as a case study, he disclosed that prior to the novel coronavirus disruption, Interswitch Group had developed a proactive crisis management plan that has enabled it navigate the business environment seamlessly to continue to offer top-notch services to its esteemed customers, during the pandemic.
