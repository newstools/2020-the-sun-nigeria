Tony Osauzo, Benin Executive of the All Progressives Congress in Ugboko Niro Ward 5, Edo State, where Osagie Ize-Iyamu registered, has authenticated his membership. Chairman of the ward, Mathew Ogbebor, who led other members of the executive on a solidarity visit to Ize-Iyamu after his victory in the party primary on Monday, dismissed speculations that the candidate failed to complete his registration at the ward level. He affirmed that a membership card signed by him was issued to the candidate after the completion of his registration in accordance with the partyâ€™s constitution last year. Ogbebor praised Ize-Iyamu as a worthy and notable member whose emergence as the candidate has united the party and provided assurances of victory at the poll.
