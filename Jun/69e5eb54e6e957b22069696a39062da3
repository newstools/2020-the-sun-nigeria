Okey Sampson, Umuahia A Methodist Bishop, Dr. Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha has called for compulsory
COVID-19 test of people above 50 years. This he said was as a result
of the daily soaring number of Coronavirus infections across the
country. Bishop Onuoha who made the call in Umuahia, said through this, people
infected by the Virus could be identified on time while isolation and
immediate treatment of the patients could commence. He urged the Federal and State governments to as a matter of urgency
and public safety heed his call, advising that it was the only way the infection of the virus which he said has reached an alarming rate as people are now leaving in fear, could be detected on time. Bishop Onuoha reminded governments at all levels of various prediction made by the World Health Organisation (WHO) concerning the number of persons estimated to die in Africa if the Virus should hit the continent hard, noting that Nigeria can avert that if the call for a nationwide testing of persons from 50 years and above was heeded. He pointed out that most countries of the world that have checked the spread of the pandemic, nipped it in the bud by carrying out compulsory test for the aged.
