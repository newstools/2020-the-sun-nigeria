Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure The frosty relationship between the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, his deputy, Agboola Ajayi and the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Ifedayo Abegunde, may have deepened as the two principal officers have continued to boycott government functions. Both Akeredolu and Abegunde had reportedly been at loggerheads over issues bordering on the second term ambition of the governor. Ajayi and Akeredolu are also said to be at war over issues relating to the next governorship election. While Akeredolu is nursing a second term ambition, the deputy governor was also alleged to be interested in his bossâ€™ position, though he has not made his decision public. It was alleged that Ajayi is making moves to join the Peoples Democratic Party to contest the governorship and he has not denied the allegation openly. On his part, the SSG is not hiding the frosty relationship between him and the governor as he often shunned government activities and political programmes of Akeredolu. Abegunde was missing at the government house, where the nomination form was presented to Governor Akeredolu after it was obtained by some of his appointees. He also shunned an event organised by Ibi Giga Ambassadors, a group championing the second term bid of Akeredolu. The SSG was equally absent at a programme where vehicles were presented to supporters of Governor Akeredolu at the weekend. Unlike Ajayi, who was said to be at the verge of joining the PDP, Abegunde was allegedly working for Segun Abraham, a governorship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress. Although the SSG has not resigned his appointment from the cabinet, it was alleged that he was planning to be running mate of Abraham.
