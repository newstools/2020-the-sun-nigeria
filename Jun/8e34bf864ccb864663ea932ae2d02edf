Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi Wife of Kebbi Governor, Hajiya Aisha Bagudu, has urged northern state governors to provide quality education to repatriated almajiri in their respective states. Hajiya Bagudu, founder of Mass Literacy Programme and Almajiri Initiative (MALPAI), told newsmen in Kebbi yesterday, that the repatriation of almajirai in some northern states to their respective states of origin was an initiative in the right direction. “The state governments, especially in the north, should take the initiative more serious and follow up the almajiri with quality education. “They governments should be mindful that before their repatriation, these children were in an environment totally away from their parents and must have been accustomed to begging and living on the streets. “This may have resulted in adoption of another moral character different from their states of origin,’’ she said. She urged them to prioritise the continuation of both Qur’anic and western education for the children now that they are living with their biological parents. “The state governments should be committed to the full protection of the fundamental human rights of the children,’’ she said. The wife of the governor also urged parents to be vigilant to know the whereabouts of their children and friends now the cases of rape were rampant in the country. She affirmed her commitment to providing support to women to engage in entrepreneurship in order to be self-reliant.
