(Reuters/NAN) Daniel Berger captured his third PGA Tour title at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth, Texas on Sunday. He did so by beating fellow American Collin Morikawa in a sudden-death playoff. Berger sealed the victory in the PGA Tour’s first event after a three-month COVID-19 break with a rock-solid par at the first extra hole. The hole was the par-four 17th, but it was where Morikawa’s par putt lipped out.
