So the issue of review might not have that in contemplation because you can’t move forward and begin to move backwards again. “In terms of the strategic implementation of our policies, we might not be looking towards that direction, but we might be looking at how to strengthen what we have put in place, how to ensure compliance and all other non-pharmaceutical interventions that we have put in place.” The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, said earlier that as at Wednesday, Nigeria had 409 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 which increased the total number of cases to 13,873; have successfully treated and discharged 4,351 persons and unfortunately lost 382 Nigerians to the disease.
