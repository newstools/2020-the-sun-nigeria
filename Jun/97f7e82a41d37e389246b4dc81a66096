Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has said his decision to contest for second term in office is to allow for continuity of his programmes and also complete all ongoing projects in the state. This is even as the governor said he was not afraid of primary. The governor said he was fully prepared for either direct or indirect election. But, he warned against bias in the conduct of the primary, stressing that he was sure of victory at the poll. Akeredolu spoke in Akure, the state capital, yesterday when he received members of the various campaign groups championing his second term election. The governor said he was determined to continue with all uncompleted projects if given the opportunity to rule for second term. He said he was concerned with the continuity of all the projects he had started, hence his desire to return to office. The governor said some of his friends have agreed to obtain the partyâ€™s nomination form, which costs N22.5 million, for him.
