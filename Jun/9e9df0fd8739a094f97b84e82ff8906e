One of the ruling houses in Iruland, Victoria Island, Lagos, the Omowumi Abisogun Oniru Ruling House, has rejected the installation of Oba Abdulwasiu Gbolahan Lawal, as the new Oniru of Iruland, on the ground that he is not a member of their family. Consequently, they called  on the Federal Government to prevail on the Lagos State Governments to reverse the installation of Lawal and chose one of them as the new king of Iruland. The family made the appeal during a protest at the Igbosere High Court of Lagos, yesterday. The newly installed king, Lawal, former Commissioner of Agriculture in Lagos State was installed on Sunday by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Head of the Omowunmi Abisogun Oniru ruling house, 88-year-old, Alhaji Surajudeen Durosinmi, said they rejected  Lawal because is not part of their ruling house.
