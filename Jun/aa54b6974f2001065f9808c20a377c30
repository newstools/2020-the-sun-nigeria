After a protracted battle with past administrations,  stakeholders from Umuagwo in Imo state have lent  their full support to Governor  Hope Uzodimma to establish new Imo state university of Agriculture and Environmental sciences on thier land, just as the government has set up a committee to midwife the take off of the university in September. The stakeholders had before now battled with past administrations against the establishment of the university because of the provision of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) and multi campus arrangement,in the law establishing it. The stakeholders said they believed that the PPP provision was  a ploy by a former governor to take over the university after leaving office, insisting that it must be hundred percent owned by government. But their  spokesman , Goddy Obodo,   told newsmen yesterday at the government house Owerri, after the inauguration of the committee on the implementation of the university, that their fears were assuaged when Uzodimma amended the law and removed the PPP clause Uzodimma on Friday set up a committee on the guidelines for the implementation of the take-off of the new University located in Umuagwo.Ohaji-Egbema with Prof. Ukachuwku Awuzie, former Vice Chancellor of the Imo State University and former President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), as the Chairman.
