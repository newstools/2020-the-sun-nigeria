Prof Igwe said that the first phase of the project had already started and it would involve the construction of six hostel blocks which are expected to be ready by the first quarter of 2021. He said that the project was coming at a time the university management was planning on ways to manage students’ accommodation against the backdrop of COVID-19 pandemic. While thanking the management of Viagem Property and Investment Ltd for undertaking the hostel project, Igwe said he was open to collaborating with other investors who would be interested in doing business with the university.

We will deliver and deliver strongly,’ Okonkwo who was represented by his Technical Officer, Engineer Emmanuel Ogbuu, said. The Dean, Student Affairs, Prof Edwin Omeje, thanked the VC for his interest in students’ welfare, stating that the last time a new block was laid for students’ hostel in the university was 42 years ago.
