An Abeokuta High Court on Friday sentenced  a 23-year-old man, Lekan Felix, to life imprisonment for abduction and raping a 15-year-old girl.  Delivering his  judgment, Justice Abiodun Adeyemi convicted Felix on two counts of having sexual intercourse and the abduction  of a child under 16 years.  The judge held that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubts.  He held that the evidence presented by the prosecution was tenable and, therefore, he had to  sentence Felix to life imprisonment.  However, the state prosecuting counsel, Mr Adekunle Sodeinde, said  that Felix the committed the offences on Feb.17, 2013 at Sango-Ota area of Ogun. According to the counsel, the convict unlawfully abducted a 15-year -old girl (names withheld), who was living with her elder sister.  He said that Felix took the girl to where her family members or anybody would not locate her whereabouts, and was having sexual intercourse with her for two years.  “The victim was sent on  an errand by her elder sister on her way she met the convict who bought drink for her.  “After taking the drink she passed out, and  few hours later on opening her eyes she met herself at Felix’s house at Ijoko village in Owode-Egba in Abeokuta.  “Felix  took advantage of her by sexually abusing her and was using her to work as a labourer on his farm land for two years before she regained her senses,” he said.  Sodeinde, however, said that Felix  confessed that he used charm on her so that she would not know where she was or think of going home.  He noted that the offences contravened Section 32 of the Child Rights Laws of Ogun and Section 362 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun 2006.  The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that as at  the time of  the incident, Lekan  was 23 years old, but at the time of his conviction, he was 30 years old. (NAN)
