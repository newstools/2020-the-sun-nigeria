Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday expressed shock over the demise of Senator Bayo Osinowo, who represented Lagos East District in the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly.
He commiserated with the National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, party chieftains, people of Lagos East, associates, relations and supporters over the irreparable loss.
Balogun said Osinowo, fondly called Pepperito by admirers, will be missed because of his commitment to the progressive ideals, mobilisation prowess, organisational acumen and total loyalty to the platform.
He said: “With gratitude to the Almighty Allah and pains in our hearts, Lagos State APC wishes to officially announce the painful exit of a consummate and dedicated chieftain, Senator Sikiru Adebayo Osinowo, who passed on last Monday after a brief illness at 64.
“Osinowo was a man of the people and a dependable stalwart held in esteem; colourful, sagacious, hardworking, goal oriented, and a grassroots mobiliser.
“He served as a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly for four terms between 2003 and 2019. He was elected into the Senate last year.
“Sentator Osinowo has since been buried in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State according to Islamic rites. Final burial arrangements will be announced by the family. May his soul rest in perfect peace.”
