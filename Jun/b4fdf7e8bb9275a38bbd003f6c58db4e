Noah Ebije, Kaduna Palpable tension of possible reprisal attacks mounted on Thursday over a lifeless body of a local farmer discovered on a farmland in Zango-Kataf community of Kaduna State. The farmer whose name was not known at the time of this report, was said to have gone to the farm Wednesday morning, but his kinsmen did not see him return home at the expected time, while night had fallen. To this end, a search party which was said to have been organised by the locals, moved to the farmland and found the farmer lying dead. Enraged by this development, youths in Zango-Kataf were said to have vowed to retaliate the killing of the farmer should any group or individual was found in connection with the alleged heinous murder.
