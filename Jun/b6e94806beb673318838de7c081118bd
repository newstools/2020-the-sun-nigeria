Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri There is palpable fear in Umuanuma community in Aboh Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo State as suspected herdsmen murder a private security operative, Mr Hycinth Ikegwu at about 6 am on Sunday while returning from work with his motorcycle. A source from the community who revealed the incident to our reporter noted that the community suspected herdsmen because of the brutal way he was murdered. Ikegwu who worked as a private security operative as we were reliably informed was said to have been brutally chopped with a very sharp objected on the head that caused him to blead to death. “Houses were around the road he was returning, he was very close to his home before they killed him . We don’t know what happened to him but because of the deep cut on his head, we just have to suspect the herdsmen.” However, contrary to the claim of the herdsmen attack, another indigene of the community who do not want his name mentioned said “it couldn’t have been herdsmen attack”. “We don’t have issues of herdsmen in our community, so I doubt he was killed by herdsmen, although the killing was too brutal as nothing was taken away from him including his motorcycle. “.The source said. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu said he was yet to be briefed on the incident.
