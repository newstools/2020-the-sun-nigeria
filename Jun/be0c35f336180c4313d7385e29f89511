Lille striker, Victor Osimhen does not dream of moving to the Premier League this summer, according to his agent. Osimhen signed for Lille last summer and enjoyed a fruitful debut campaign, which saw him net 18 goals and grab six assists before the French league season was curtailed last month. The 21-year-old’s fine form in front of goal led to reports linking him with a move to England this summer, with Manchester United one side tipped to make a move. Suggestions of a move to United were amplified when fans’ favourite Odion Ighalo labelled his Nigerian compatriot as ‘the future of football’ two months ago, but it seems as though they’ll have to wait if they are to sign the forward. Addressing a rumour that a deal with Napoli is close the player’s brother-in-law and agent, Osita Okolo, also shot down reports of a move to England. “I can say that, for now, Osimhen hasn’t agreed anything with Napoli or another club,” Okolo told Radio Marte. “I can also deny that he dreams of going to the Premier League, I don’t know why the press says certain things. Naples is a fantastic city and Napoli are a very good team.
