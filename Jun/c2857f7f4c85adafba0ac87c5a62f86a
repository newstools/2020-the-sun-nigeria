Leading indigenous broadcasting brand, Wazobia Media, Wazobia FM and Wazobia TV, has partnered with the Lagos State government through the Lagos State Ministry of Education in providing remote learning services for students in Nigeria due to the closure of schools following the outbreak and quick spread of the Covid-19 virus. The compulsory shutdown of schools which took place in March 2020 across all federal and state owned institutions was to ensure the safety of students while combating the spread of the virus. In a bid to lessen the impact in disrupted curricular activities due to the nationwide school closure, and ensuring that students are better prepared for their upcoming examinations, especially those in the Senior Secondary School preparing for the West African Examination Council (WAEC) and National Examination Council (NECO) exams, the partnership between Wazobia Media and the Lagos State Ministry of Education is one that gives parents and students the unique opportunity to experience free seamless daily learning by top accredited tutors on dedicated programs on Wazobia Max TV channel UHF 57 from 2pm till 4pm and on Wazobia FM from 12pm till 2pm daily, Mondays to Fridays, totaling 4 hours of learning material daily. The Program has been running since Monday March 30th and will continue throughout the school closure period. Speaking on the Partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, Co-Founder and CEO of Wazobia, Tatiana Moussalli Nouri stated that, “the educational broadcast by the Wazobia Media Brand is one driven by the commitment of the organization in adding value through investments that are incalculable in educating students and members of the society”. “The daily broadcast, which commenced on the 30th of March 2020 covered various subjects such as Mathematics, English Language, Chemistry, Physics, Financial Accounting, Biology, Economics, Yoruba and Literature in English has redefined learning for students especially during a global pandemic as this ingenious engagement has afforded millions of students across Nigeria, the opportunity to excel at their forthcoming examinations.” Tatiana added.
