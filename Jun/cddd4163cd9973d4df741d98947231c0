A statement from the Agency, on Sunday, indicated that some state of the Agency had contact with a woman who died of suspected COVID-19-related complications, hence the decision to decontaminate the entire premises. The statement which was signed by the Head, Press and Public Relations Unit, NAPTIP, Stella Nezan, indicated that all the staff members would be tested for COVID-19 before returning to work.
