The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has cautioned Nigerians against building houses under high tension power transmission lines to avoid electrocution. NEMA South-East Coordinator, Mr Fred Anusim, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Monday. Anusim noted that electricity transmission and high tension wires could snap (break/cut) and fall anytime without given notice or pre-warning. According to him, it will be difficult to imagine the disaster such an incident would cause if the wire fall on the roof of an inhabited building. The coordinator noted that Nigerians must observe and take note of structures within an environment before investing in building or renting apartment therein. “As NEMA moves from reactionary to proactive emergency response, it is pertinent that those already living under Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) electricity power lines or power lines right-of-way should make haste to relocate and leave in a safe place. “NEMA is also discouraging Nigerians from building under electricity high tension wires or close to it. “Nigerians must think safety first especially in choosing or finding a place to build or reside with their families. “Building and estate developers should not build under or very close to these high tension wires; as they risk their lives and that of others that will unsuspecting inhabit such a place,’’ he said. Anusim also urged Nigerians to desist from erecting make-shift structures, such as trading shades or shops, under high tension wire or close to power line right-of-way. NAN reports that one Mrs Patience Ugbana, 55, and her 10-year-old granddaughter, Adaeze, were electrocuted after a high tension wire fell on their shop in Nnewi, Anambra state on May 8.(NAN)
