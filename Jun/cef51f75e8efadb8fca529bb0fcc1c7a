Since seminars , trainings could not hold due to the pandemic, we decided to use the fund to provide the equipment. We found some local producers who made these great quality products. Everything we are presenting today were locally sourced and worth N130 million. I am hopeful that they will be put into good use”. On the issuance of visas during this period of coronavirus crisis, Traumann, said, “it is very difficult at the moment to talk about visas because it is s difficult to travel to Germany as the airports are closed and therefore it’s not easy to enter the European Union, till the end of June”.
