Monica Iheakam The Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) will be among the beneficiaries of the $11.65m COVID-19 funding packages to be released by the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) for member nations. Rising from their Technical Working Group meeting which included representatives from member countries and the continental associations, ANOC agreed that all the 206 members will benefit from the largesse. According to ANOC, the funding is geared towards helping all the countries preparing for the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. “We are committed to helping NOCs and their athletes prepare for Tokyo 2020 by providing additional funding that will assist NOCs with the exceptional costs associated with the delay of the Games,” said ANOC’s Acting President, Robin Mitchell.
