Commenting on the report, the Managing Director of Jaiz Bank, Hassan Usman, said that the feats were achieved as a result of the bank’s deliberate policy to focus on building a culture of ethics and taking the necessary decisions to align its perspective with client expectations. He said the result is a proof of the added value of the management’s continuous strive towards making the bank the preferred institution for all stakeholders which was supported by the outcome of the bank’s maiden external credit rating conducted by the International Islamic Rating Agency. Usman said: ‘An investment-grade rating of A+ (short term) was assigned to the Bank, which is a resounding corroboration of the Bank’s sound financial health. In the years ahead, we shall continue to deepen our engagement with the MSME, agri-businesses across all value chains and focus on unserved markets and the financially excluded segments of our society. This we believe within the current context of our society shall create an institution that will pass the test of time.’
