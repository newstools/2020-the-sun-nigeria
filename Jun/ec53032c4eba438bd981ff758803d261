The head of the management committee of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, has affirmed that the women’s league body has the mandate to evolve into a global league brand, capable of competing favourably with top women’s leagues across the world. Falode said this at the NWFL-LaLiga Coaches Online Training Masterclass aimed at taking coaches in the various women’s clubs in Nigeria to greater heights. The training programme, in partnership with LaLiga, is a step further in the development of the women’s game with the LaLiga women’s league, one of the activation points of the MoU signed in 2018 between the NWFL and LaLiga. Falode, in her opening speech at the online training programme yesterday, expressed her gratitude to LaLiga, most especially to Pedro Malabia, Head of La Liga Women Football and the entire LaLiga team for their help and commitment in making the training programme a reality. She noted: “The NWFL began in 1990 and its 30 years in 2020.   One of the best ways to celebrate is to improve the quality of play in our clubs. That is to play beautiful, modern and progressive brands of football that will help develop quality of the league and attract more fans to the clubs.
