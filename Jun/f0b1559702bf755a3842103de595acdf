In his remarks,  Nnorom thanked the Association for the confidence reposed on him as Chairman, and the Board of Trustees,  noting  that  liquidity arising from the debts owed GenCos for power already generated, transmitted and consumed by Nigerians would seriously affect the Association. “As an association, there are immediate challenges we must tackle. For instance, we appreciate the recent improvement in payment by Nigerian Bulk Electricity Traders (NBET) of money owed us” he said. According to Nnorom,  such improvement should  remain consistent while other outstanding legacy debts  equally owed members be paid to enable them meet funding obligations critical to their ability to stay in  operation.The statement noted that Nnorom’s tenure, was instrumental in promoting the Association’s mandate of driving synergy and commercial viability within Nigeria’s power sector.
