Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied insinuations that its Caretaker Committee has released any form of zoning arrangement for the proposed Extra-Ordinary National Convention. In a statement issued by the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, the committee pointed out that it will notify party members if there is a need for such an arrangement. Titled “Purported zoning arrangement for planned APC National Convention is fake”, the statement read: ‘A purported zoning arrangement for the planned National Convention of the APC which has gone viral in the social media is fake. ‘Party members, supporters, stakeholders and indeed the general public are advised to disregard the fake news.
