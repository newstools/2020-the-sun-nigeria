Setting the tone for the conversation, Suleiman said the hot topic was considered in the best interest of the country and her promising, highly enterprising and energetic youth. He said profiling any person as criminal for wearing dreadlocks or tattoos is wrong; and such labelling can only be addressed by important and truthful conversations among all stakeholders. Opening the conversation, Badmos commended Sterling Bank for hosting the session aimed at fostering peaceful relations between the police and the general public. “What Sterling Bank has done is commendable. It shows that the Bank recognizes that preventing anarchy and enhancing security is everybody’s businesses. This innovation will forever linger in the heart of Nigerians, especially the youth.” The former Lagos PPRO attributed the profiling of youths with tattoos and dreads as criminals by officers of the Nigerian Police Force to the difference in culture and values, adding that Nigerian police is work in progress and will evolve in line with global trends On his part, Awosanya said the usual social media controversy over attacks of defenseless Nigerians by police officers and use of force against the youth are not unconnected to the many years of military rule which make many officers see leadership as a show of control by force.
