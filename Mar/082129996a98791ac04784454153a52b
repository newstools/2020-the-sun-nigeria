In line with his avowed mandate of discovering young talents and nurturing them to stardom, Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare has offered scholarship to five-year old boxing sensation, Ayomide Adeyemo. Dare who refers to himself as the ‘Chief Talent Hunter’ said he was moved by a viral video of the young talented boxer “Sequel to the viral video of a talented baby boy boxer in media pages, I will be putting the baby in a boxing academy for further growth and also sponsor his education. Some financial stipends will be given for the upkeep of the lad as well.” The five-year-old Ayomide is so talented that he could be a future Olympian, as he would be properly groomed and monitored. The young boxer would be under the tutelage of his father, Mr. Adeyemo acting as his trainer.
