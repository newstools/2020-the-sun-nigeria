Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin The Edo State governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has sworn-in Peter Aguele as the new chairman of Esan South East Local Government, following the judgment of the Edo State High Court declaring him the rightful winner of the chairmanship primaries in the council. Obaseki, who congratulated the new chairman, noted that his administration respects the rule of law, which is why it acted in accordance with the court order. “Our government respects the rule of law that is why upon receiving the court order, we immediately obeyed and affirmed your victory by swearing you in. “You are assuming office at a very difficult time, when the revenue of local governments is seriously challenged. The revenue is significantly down and the expectations of our people are very high. You have a lot of work to do politically in ensuring that Esan South East is stable and that the people enjoy the dividends of democracy under your watch,” he said. Obaseki added: “I want to assure you that we will support you to ensure you overcome any challenges you will be facing in office; but ensure you carry your people along.” Responding, the new chairman noted that his victory at the court was a victory for democracy and Esan South-East people. He said: “The case was a pre-election matter. I had filed that I am the rightful candidate for the election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), following my victory at the chairmanship primary and the court granted my prayers, ordering that I should be sworn-in immediately. “The governor didn’t waste time in carrying out the order of the court showing that the Governor Obaseki-led administration and the APC as a party obey the rule of law. We have a governor that has given everyone a level-playing ground. I assure my people that I will not disappoint them.”
