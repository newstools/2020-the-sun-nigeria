The experts expressed fears that the stay- at- home order would increase intimacy between couples that will ultimately lead to procreation and potential population explosion in the nearest future.

The centres visited were Alihame Primary Healthcare Centre in Ika South and Owa-Oyibu Primary Healthcare Centre in Ika North-East.
