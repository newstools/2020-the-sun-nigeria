The head of the religious sect that has been at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea has apologised to the nation for the disease’s spread. Lee Man-hee, the leader of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, got on his knees and bowed at a news conference. About 60% of the country’s more than 4,000 confirmed cases are sect members. Deaths nationwide now stand at 28. Fatalities globally have now passed the 3,000 mark, although the vast majority are in China, where the outbreak began. Worldwide, there have been almost 90,000 confirmed cases, with the numbers outside China now growing faster than inside China.(BBC)
