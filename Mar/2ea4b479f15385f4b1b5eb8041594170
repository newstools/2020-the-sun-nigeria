Moshood Adebayo Despite the stringent measures introduced, Lagos Government, yesterday, said the state was not on lockdown. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, described as erroneous the rumour that Governor Babajide Sanw-Olu had ordered the lockdown of the state. “The impression created by such reports is erroneous; Lagos is not on lockdown despite the stringent measures introduced by the government,” he said. Omotoso added that Sanwo-Olu, in his capacity as the incident commander, only urged private sector establishments to introduce measures that will support the government’s efforts at curtailing the spread of COVID-19.
