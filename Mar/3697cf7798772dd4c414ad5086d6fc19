I won the league 2015/16 season and also lost in Cup final by penalty shootout. “Last year, I took another step forward and challenge myself by training a female team in the Bundesliga 3 professional league and this has prepared me to handle any female team, including the Nigeria national teams,” he said. “It’s my pride and honour to give back to my country, what I know how to do best and ready to coach any level of our national teams, especially the female under aged teams.
