This was achieved at Gorigi in the Allagarno Forest general area of Borno State on 23 March 2020. “The routing occurred when the Land Component of Operation LAFIYA DOLE conducting clearance operations along the Allagarno Forest axis, as part of the ongoing subsidiary Operation, ‘Operation AYISO TAMONUMA’, came into contact with mounted BHTs. Accordingly, air assets, including an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform and fighter jets, were immediately scrambled to provide Close Air Support to the troops.
