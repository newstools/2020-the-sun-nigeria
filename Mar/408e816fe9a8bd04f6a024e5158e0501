The Herbs Sellers Association of Nigeria (HSAN) in Lagos State says the rush for Laganaria Breviflorus, locally known as “Tagairi”, and Neem or Azadirachta Indica, locally known as “Dogoyaro” leaves, has increased since the incidence of Coronavirus in the country. Alhaja Modinat Fasuyi-Onike, HSAN Chairman in Alade Market, Shomolu and Financial Secretary, Elewe Omo Herbs Sellers Association of Nigeria, made the disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) in Lagos on Thursday. Fasuyi-Onike said: “We gathered from the people that someone posted on the social media the effectiveness of ‘tagiri’ , as it is believed that when thrown on the floor prevents the spread of any virus like measles and chicken pox. “Also, that the Dogoyaro plant is used in the cure for malaria. “So, the demand is higher now as we have seen in our markets. “I think the demand for Dogoyaro is on the increase because to us, it is an alternative to the Chloroquine tablets,  and since it is said that the symptoms of COVID-19 include high fever similar to those of malaria, people are rushing Dogoyaro” She told NAN that the association, however, condemned the use of the herbs as a cure for COVID-19 yet without adequate scientific or medical research proof. She urged citizens to wait till authoritative confirmation are made on the cure for COVID-19 by relevant authorities before linking the leaves as cure to the disease. However, she affirmed that there were no side effects to using Dogoyaro plant and tagiri, especially in the treatment of malaria. Fasuyi-Onike advised Nigerians to pay attention to government advice by adopting good hygiene in curbing the spread of COVID-19. (NAN)
