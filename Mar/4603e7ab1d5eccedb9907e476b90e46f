According to him, the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) has developed a “two-pronged” approach to fight the pandemic, namely; the medical and security approaches. “Sequell to the on-going fight against the spread of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the Federal Government of Nigeria, the AFN has put measures in place to aid the civil authorities.
