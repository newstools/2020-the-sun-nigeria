The Industrial Goods (-0.5 per cent) index also followed suit. The Insurance (+3.3 per cent) and Banking (+2.1 per cent) indices were the sole gainers. Reacting to the development, Cordros Capital, in their weekly assessment of the market, said that the trend is likely to persist and advised investors to take positions in fundamental stocks. They said: “In our view, the trend witnessed this week is likely to persist, as weakening market sentiment in the face of the fast-spreading Coronavirus pandemic and the weakness across global markets are expected to pressure market returns. Nonetheless, we advise investors to take positions in fundamentally justified stocks”. On his part, Managing Director, Decof Investments, Moses Igbrude, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the performance of the market. “The issue is that if we look what is happening outside Nigeria, the issue is very serious. Even in Nigeria, I am sure that the number of infected people are more than what they are saying is the actual figure, so we need to be very careful as investors have to be alive to make any investment particularly on the floor of the NSE. I would thus say we should be cautious and adhere to what the NCDC and WHO have said we should do”, he said.
