Adie, who said that the consignment was duly escorted by personnel of the police Explosive Ordinance (EOD), added that the vehicle developed a fault and exploded on the road. “The truck was coming from Lagos State to Edo State; unfortunately along the road, their vehicle developed a fault and the driver noticed it. ” In fact from the explanation of the escort commander, they had to try to move it away from where there were houses. “When they parked and came out and noticed there was smoke coming out from the engine, the driver’s effort to put it off was not possible and fire broke out,” he said. The commissioner said the police escort had to deploy the standard professional drill in handling the incident. ” We thank God that  this area houses a church  and school; fortunately the school, because of the closure, had no student. “But we have commenced investigation and I have called the managing director of the company who was to receive the consignment,” he said.

He said that personnel of the EOD in the command had been on the ground since the incident occurred  to cordon the area. Also.speaking, Brig.-Gen.
