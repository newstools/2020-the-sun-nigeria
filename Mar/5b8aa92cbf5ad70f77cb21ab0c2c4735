George Onyejiuwa, Owerri Security in Imo State has been stepped up ahead of the Supreme Court judgement in the Imo State governorship dispute between ousted Governor Emeka Ihedioha and Governor Hope Uzodinma. Heavily armed security agents including soldiers are stationed at strategic junctions in Owerri, the state capital. Armed security agents are also stationed at the entrance to the Imo State Government House. The presence of security agents is to forestall any breach of the peace as a result of the politically volatile atmosphere in the state, Daily Sun has learnt.
