Fred Ezeh, Abuja The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) under the leadership of its President-General, Alh Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, has ordered the shut down of mosques in Abuja effective from Monday. NSCIA Director of Administration, Alh Yusuf Nwoha, in a statement released in Abuja on Monday, explained that the decision was taken after consultations with Muslim scholars and other relevant stakeholders. He said the decision was also in support of efforts by the Federal Government to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). He said: “As hard as this decision is, it became necessary that Muslims join hands with Federal Government and its agencies in the sustained fight against the spread of the dreaded COVID-19 which the World Health Organization (WHO) has since declared a pandemic. “The decision to close down Mosques is not alien to Islamic tradition and culture as it could be traced to the time of our noble Prophet (S.A.W). In such a situation, the (Mu’adhdhin) is asked to inform the believers to pray in their dwellings.” “The NSCIA, therefore, solicits the cooperation of Imams and all Muslims in the FCT to ensure compliance with the directive as it is in the interest of all and sundry. “May Allah Subhanahu Wata’ala assist humanity to stop the spread of this deadly disease across all the nations, and protect us all, Amen,” he prayed.
