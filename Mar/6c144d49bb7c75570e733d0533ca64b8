We had already looked at the other part earlier when I said it was 90% ready, when I came the last time it was just rafters for the gym, we have seen that everything is almost set, by Sunday or Monday that place will be fully ready. “We have seen the court, Ogbe Hard Court is ready, and we have seen the main bowl itself is ready, Saturday tested the tracks by our athletes and it means that it is ready.”
