 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he will continue to lead the nation from home after testing positive for Covid-19. “I’ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus, that’s a temperature and a persistent cough,” Mr Johnson said in a video posted on his Twitter account. “On the advice of the chief medical officer, I have taken a test and that has come out positive. “I’m working from home and self-isolating. That’s entirely the right thing to do. “I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of technology, to communicate with my top team and lead the national fightback against the virus.” (BBC)eaking News: British PM tests for coronavirus, vows to lead fight from home
