The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has assured parents and guardians of the corps members currently undergoing orientation at various camps across the country not to panic over the deadly Coronavirus disease. 
The statement signed by the management further disclosed that adequate preventive measures have been taken to guard against the contraction of the disease by the corps members.
According to the statement; “Following the outbreak of Coronavirus, the NYSC Scheme as a proactive measure embarked on far-reaching actions in order to guard against the contraction of the deadly virus by corps members.
“Accordingly, the scheme has been in constant touch with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, as well as the Federal Ministry of Health which have been playing very supportive roles by lending technical support to the Scheme.
“It is gratifying to note that infrared thermometers, as well as hand sanitisers, wash hand basins and soaps have been provided in all the 37 NYSC Secretariats and at strategic locations at Orientation camps of the Scheme nationwide.
“Similarly, sensitisation leaflets on Lassa fever and Coronavirus have been shared to all the 2020 Batch ‘A’ Corps Members currently undergoing Orientation course, so as to arm them with the requisite information on the viruses and how to prevent infection.
“Additionally, the Camp communities and other serving corps members are regularly sensitised on the best approach to adopt in order to prevent contraction of the viruses.
“The management of the Scheme wishes to assure the parents and guardians of the Corps Members that there is no cause for alarm as the Scheme remains alive to its core responsibility of catering to the welfare of corps members,” the statement read.
