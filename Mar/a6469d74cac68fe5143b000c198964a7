Makinde, chairman, Electoral Panel for the Edo State Congress,  gave the advice while formally declaring results of the elections The governor who was represented by his political adviser, Babatunde Oduyoye, said Hon. Tony Aziegbemi was new chairman of the party in Edo, having polled 817 votes to defeat his closest rival, Felix Imoisili, who scored 488 votes. He said with the turn out in the delegates’ election, if the party can work together they would be able to win the forthcoming governorship election in the state, noting that PDP is still very strong in Edo State like other South South states, even as he described the congress as ‘generally peaceful’.  “With the new executive, PDP should be able to win the forthcoming governorship election considering the situation on ground. You have to take advantage of what is on the ground,” he said. Speaking on the congress, a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ogbiede Ihama, described it as a positive development for the party in the state.
