Double your efforts so that this airport can be used before Easter. “There are certain things you complained about; the consultant said they have been taken care of. So I don’t think there will be issues. We are pleading with you to deliver quality work as scheduled. We don’t want to disappoint our people. We want to make sure that we live up to our promise.”
