Nigerian international, Odion Ighalo vowed to give his ‘blood’ for opportunities to shine in Manchester United’s first-team. The striker, who signed on a six-month loan on January deadline day had made a steady start to life at Old Trafford. He bagged his first United goal in their Europa League victory over Club Brugge on Thursday. There were suggestions he could have started their Premier League trip to Everton, however, Anthony Martial had been passed fit for the Goodison Park clash. But former Watford man, Ighalo revealed he’ll be ready for action when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gives him chances in the future. He told the club’s official website: “This is what I’m working for. Simon Jordan takes on super-agent Mino Raiola over his Man United feud “This is what I dream of and what I dreamt of when I was a kid. Now it is in my hands, so I have to fight for it. I will give my blood to get it. “I am still working hard in every training session and doing some extra to make sure I get up to the level. When I’m called upon, I will give my best.” United had been in good form since Ighalo signed, having not lost in its last five matches. And Ighalo was full of praise for his new teammates, including his main rival for a starting spot up front, Martial. Ighalo added: “We have quality players in the team. Martial is on fire, scoring goals. Bruno Fernandes is doing well, Daniel James too, everybody from the goalkeeper to the top is working really hard. “So I think this is very good for the team. We need to keep the momentum going and keep winning games and fighting in every match, to make sure we get our objectives at the end of the season.”
