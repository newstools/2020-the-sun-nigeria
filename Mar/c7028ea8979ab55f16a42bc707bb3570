One Mohammed Jammil Guddare made overzealous but futile attempt to have an unauthorised handshake with the President thus breaching security protocols. “He was stopped by security details and arrested for a thorough investigation. Preliminary investigation reveals that he is not a hostile person but an overzealous enthusiast of the President. “The Service has reviewed the video of the incident and is taking measures against its personnel found to have been negligent in their duties,” the statement read.
