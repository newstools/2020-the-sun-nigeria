The monitoring of compliance with the Federal government directives commenced in 33 States, yesterday, with State Monitoring leaders moving from school to school. The TRCN boss who maintained that quality of teachers teaching will affect the quality of education and learning outcomes stated that the FG will not trade teacher professionalism with anything. “TRCN monitoring of compliance commences nationwide today in 33 States and FCT with TRCN officials and State Monitoring team leaders moving from school to school.  the exercise is not aimed at witchhunt. “It is primarily designed to sanitize the teaching profession of quackery.
