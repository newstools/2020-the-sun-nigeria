QPR attacker and Tottenham transfer target, Eberechi Eze has opened up about his difficult decision whether to pursue an international career with England or Nigeria. Eze is one of the most highly rated talents in the Championship, and had scored 12 goals in 37 league appearances this season for the QPR. So impressive has his form been this term that he had been tipped with a move across London to Spurs. However, it doesn’t look like which club he plays for is Eze’s main concern right now, as he faced a dilemma about which nation to represent. The £9m-rated prospect had played for England in youth football, but qualifies to represent Nigeria due to his African ancestry. Back in 2017, Eze trained with the Super Eagles while they were in London, an experience he said he enjoyed. But he insisted he didn’t want to rush into a decision, as he weighed up more playing time with Nigeria or potential European success with England. “I’m very happy to be part of England’s youth setup right now, but I enjoyed training with Nigeria,” Eze told FourFourTwo. “It’s a privilege to be involved with both, but I don’t want to make a decision yet – I just need to focus on QPR.” Eze went on to discuss the areas of improvements he was to see in his game in the future. And despite usually playing in attacking-midfield or on the wing, the 21-year-old said he wants to help out his backline more by improving his positioning when it comes to tracking back. “Defensively, I could be better,” Eze added. “It’s the last thing I want to do, as an attacking player, but my positioning when we lose the ball would help with that. “Top players today need to be well-rounded – attackers don’t get away with being passengers. I’ve realised that more than ever this season.”
