Speaking at the convocation, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Chigozie Ogbu, said that the awardees were picked for the awards for their wonderful contributions to the development of Ebonyi State, Nigeria and humanity in general. Responding on behalf of the awardees, Chief Nwobodo thanked the university for the awards, noting that it would spur them to continue to contribute their quota to the development of the country and humanity at large. He also urged the Southeast governors to wake up and take firm position against the escalating insecurity in the zone, stressing that the time has come for them take the issue of security in the region very seriously. Nwobodo also said that there would be serious change in the country if an Igbo man is given the opportunity to serve as president of the country in 2023. He lamented that people from the Southeast no longer go to their farms because of fear of being killed by Fulani herdsmen who have taken over the zone with impunity.
