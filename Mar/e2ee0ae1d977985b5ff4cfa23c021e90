THE Governor of Osun state, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, has expressed his gratitude to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State for providing logistical assistance to some Osun indigenes who were returning to the state from a Francophone African country. Oyetola registered his gratitude through a statement, where he noted that governor Abiodun had graciously called him to inform him about the returnees who were identified at the Ogun border as indigenes of Osun.
