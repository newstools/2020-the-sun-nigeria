Reacting to the development, Analysts at Afrinvest said, “with the widespread of COVID-19 inducing a four-year low in global crude oil prices, we believe the dark clouds are gathering. As such, we expect investors to remain risk-averse towards the equities market in the near term, although there is headroom for bargain hunting activities due to cheap valuation of stocks and the local bourse relative to peers”.
