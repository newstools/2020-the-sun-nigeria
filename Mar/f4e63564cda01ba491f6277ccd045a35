Data contributed 18.8 per cent to service revenue, up 3.9pp from 14.9 per cent in 2018.” “Digital revenue gained momentum as we started to see quarterly growth from Q3 2019.

In Q4 2019, we launched MusicTime, one of our flagship digital offerings. The active base for our digital subscriptions surpassed 2.1 million users during the year, as we continue to build critical mass for our portfolio of digital products and services. On a sequential QoQ  basis, digital revenue increased by 23.0% and we target sustained growth into 2020. We acknowledge the outbreak of Coronavirus worldwide and its potential impact on our supply chain.  While we monitor unfolding developments, we are exploring multiple scenarios in a bid to mitigate the impact. “Over the next three years, we plan to invest about N600 billion in our network. This investment will enable us to accelerate our 4G network expansion, deepen population coverage and support the Federal Government’s broadband initiative. We are excited about the possibilities that the transition to digital presents for our business, and the growth and development of Nigeria.” Commenting on the result, CEO, MTN Nigeria, Ferdi Moolman, said: “I am pleased with our performance in 2019, which demonstrates the progress we have made in the implementation of our BRIGHT strategy. Despite a challenging operating environment, we continued to deliver double-digit growth in service revenue in line with our medium-term guidance. Voice revenue growth remained healthy, and data revenue continued to accelerate, supporting a 12.6% increase in service revenue with an acceleration in growth to 14.0% YoY in Q4 2019. “Following the completion of the SIM re-registration exercise in Q3 2019, we recorded 2.7 million net additions in Q4. In total, we added 6.1 million new subscribers to our network  in 2019. Although the last quarter is usually seasonally strong, service revenue growth (14%)  in Q4 outpaced the seasonal effect. “In the third quarter, we focused on several initiatives to enhance coverage and drive data usage penetration. These initiatives include optimising frequencies, expanding our 4G network coverage with over 6,000 additional sites leveraging 800MHz spectrum and repositioning our commercial data offerings.
