Argentinian security forces have detained more than 6,000 people since extensive restrictions on personal movement were introduced in a bid to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic. Criminal charges have been filed against 6,191 suspects throughout the country, the presidential office said in a statement late on Thursday. The police also said they had confiscated 938 vehicles. More than 200,000 people had been sent home during checks, as they were not authorised to move around freely outdoors, the statement continued. So far, 503 people in Argentina have been infected with the novel coronavirus and nine have died. To slow the spread of the virus, the government decided on a nationwide lockdown. People all around the country are not allowed to leave their homes until March 31. Only errands to nearby grocery stores and pharmacies are allowed, though essential workers are exempted from the curfew. These include doctors, nurses and police officers, supermarket, pharmacy and logistics workers, and employees in the food, pharmaceutical and petroleum industries. (dpa/NAN)
