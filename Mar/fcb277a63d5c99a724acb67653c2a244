The African Democratic Congress (ADC) Lagos State chapter has disassociated itself from the decision of a faction of the political party at the national level to merge with the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The ‘merger’ talks which held in Ibadan, Oyo State, recently were led by a factional leader of ADC. According to a source, the intention was to take all the South West chapters of ADC  along  with them to PDP. However, the ‘merger’ meeting was allegedly held without the knowledge of the national chairman of ADC, Ralph Nwosu. In a statement issued by the chairman, caretaker committee of Lagos  ADC, Olayiwola Abisoye, the party has not collapsed into or merged with the PDP or any other political party in Nigeria. “All members and stakeholders of ADC should disregard any publication that the party has merged or collapsed into PDP or any other political party.  ADC as a party, is not merging or collapsing into PDP or any other party. We remain the only credible alternative party in Nigeria.  We are on a mission to rescue Nigeria from 16 years of PDP fiasco and eight years of APC disaster. “Everyone is allowed freedom of association, but ADC remains firm,” he said. Corroborating Abisoye, Mabel Oboh, deputy publicity secretary of ADC Lagos State chapter, stated that the party remains indivisible. “There is no cause for alarm.  ADC is very much intact, working towards making Nigeria a better country come 2023,” she stated.
