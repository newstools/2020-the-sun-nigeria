An 82-year-old widow who is also suffering from hypertension has recovered from the coronavirus disease after receiving nine-day treatment at the Isolation and Treatment Centre, Asubiaro, Osogbo, in Osun State. She was confirmed positive and admitted at the State isolation centre on May 13. The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu, who disclosed this in a statement on Friday in Osogbo, said the septuagenarian’s recovery from the virus beats the odds as elderly people with chronic diseases are the highest risk group because  most of the time they are unable to recover from COVID-19. He noted that the patient who contracted the disease from coming in contact with an infected person showed no symptoms of the virus on arrival at the isolation centre except for diarrhoea. Isamotu said: “The story of the 82-year-old widow who recovered from the dreaded coronavirus provides a glimmer of hope, considering that she is a hypertensive patient on medication. Although when she arrived at our isolation centre on the 13th of May, she had no cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, fever or anosmia associated with the virus except for diarrhoea and we successfully treated her for it. “On arrival, her sample was taken, sent for testing at the NCDC accredited testing centre in Ede and returned positive for the virus. We immediately commenced treatment and she was stable all through the period of hospitalization. On her 9th day on admission, we carried out a follow-up polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on her and the result came back negative and she was subsequently discharged on the 24th of May, 2020. Furthermore, a follow-up at her home after her discharge revealed that she was stable.”
