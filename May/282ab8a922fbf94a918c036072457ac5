Magnus Eze, Enugu Dangote Industries Limited has denied that it trucks were being used in smuggling northern youths into the southern parts of the country, especially the South East. The management of the organisation in a letter to the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, described the allegation in some quarters as spurious and misleading. Recently, Nwodo had reportedly said that vehicles belonging to the companies of Aliko Dangote, were notorious in transporting northern youth to the South. The letter by the Group Chief Branding and Communications Officer, Anthony Chiejina, dated May 27, 2020, urged the public to help it rid the organisation of illegal haulage activities perpetuated by some unscrupulous persons. He, however, warned those illegally transporting materials on Dangote trucks that such unauthorised goods shall be confiscated and the drivers and owners of the goods prosecuted according to the law. He also explained that their trucks were only permitted to carry Dangote products including limestone, high grade gypsum and coal. Chiejina also appealed to members of the public to report any defaulting trucks to the management of the group. “We plead with the public that while making the report, to remember to include the following details: truck type, truck plate number, truck cab no, location of truck, contents of truck, colour of the truck and photographs of the truck and goods if possible. “The police and/or law enforcement agents are also authorised to arrest any Dangote driver involved in such illegal act,” he stated. He added that only two persons – the driver and his assistant are authorised to be in their truck at any time.    function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
