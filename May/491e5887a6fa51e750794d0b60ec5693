Speaking to brila.net, the former coach who has played, coached, and also managed clubs in the league said there was remarkable progress in the league now when compared to 30 years ago. “At least, there are stadiums everywhere now, right? That’s some improvement. “We have also improved in terms of players’ welfare but things can be better,” the former coach added. “But until we start leaving the government out of clubs management, we still have a long way to go.” “We need the government to take off their hands off club management totally, we need to get sponsors to do these things, sports is business.’
