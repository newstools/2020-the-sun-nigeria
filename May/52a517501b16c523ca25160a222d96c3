In his remarks, the paramount ruler commended the staff and management of the company for their kind gesture and extolled the virtues of Chief Okonji whose level of philanthropy he described as unequalled. He further emphasised that he and the Chief-in-Council have decided to honour him with the title, the Babalaje of Papalanto. Reacting, the GPC Energy & Logistics boss thanked the Kabiyesi for his accommodating spirit and support which he has always given to him and GPC Energy & Logistics since it began operation over two decades ago and enjoined the Oni Papa to use His good office in ensuring that his subjects abide by all the safety rules designed by PTF to checkmate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic which is real.
