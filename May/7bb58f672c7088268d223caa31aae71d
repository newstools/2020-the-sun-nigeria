Disagreement over modalities to adopt for a shadowy election to elect a consensus aspirant among some governorship aspirants at a meeting called by some leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, was deadlocked in Benin City. It was, however, gathered that consultation is continuing and a fresh meeting would be rescheduled. The meeting scheduled to holdÂ  at the residence of a former deputy governor, Lucky Imasuen, was reportedly disrupted during the process of trying to agree on the modalities. Controversy was said to have arisen when a decision was taken to allow 14-member-elect of the State House of Assembly who are yet to resume sitting to vote.
