Lukman Olabiyi The Federal High Court, Lagos, has fixed June 2 to hear a motion on notice seeking the release from prison of Senate Chief Whip and former Abia State governor, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu. The motion will be heard by Justice Mohammed Liman. Kalu, who  is currently in custody of the Correctional Service Centre in Kuje, Abuja, filed the suit after the Supreme Court nullified his conviction by  Justice Muhammed Idris. The Senate’s Chief Whip has hired 12 lawyers, including six Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs) to seek his freedom. He filed the motion on May 12 asking the court to order his release since the Supreme Court had nullified his conviction on the grounds that Justice Idris had no jurisdiction to have delivered the judgment, having been promoted to the Court of Appeal. Justice Idris of the Federal High Court, last December 5, convicted Kalu, and a former Director of Finance in the Abia State Government House, Ude Jones Udeogu of the offence bordering on alleged fraud . Following Udeogu’s appeal, the Supreme Court on May 8 held that the fiat issued to Justice Idris to conclude the case after he had been elevated to the Court of Appeal was “a nullity”. The apex court set aside Justice Idris’ verdict and  ordered Udeogu’s freedom and the retrial of his case. Since Kalu and Udeogu were tried and convicted together by Justice Idris, the senator is now contending that no legal basis exists for his continued incarceration as the Supreme Court had declared his conviction and sentencing a nullity.
