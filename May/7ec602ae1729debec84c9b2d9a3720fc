He advised the people to guard against such acts to avoid prosecution in line with extant laws of the service. He said that the NIS and the Navy intercepted 10 Nigerians heading to Cameroon during the border closure to curb communal and State to state spread of COVID-19 pandemic. “Few days ago some numbers were arrested and refused departure, this set embarked from Eshiet Village, Adadia Control post Axis in Uruan Local Government Area. “Two from Cross River and eight from Akwa-Ibom states respectively. The ten were forwarded to health officials for medical checks to ascertain their COVID-19 status and related ailments. “They were returned to their localities after clearance by the health officials and profiling by the NIS Operatives,” he said.
