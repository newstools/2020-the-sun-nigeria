A devastated President of the NFF, Amaju Melvin Pinnick paid tributes to Okenwa, who was part of a meeting of the NFF Executive Committee held via video conferencing penultimate Friday. It was that same day that Okenwa celebrated his 50th birthday. “This is a huge shock. Each and everyone of us on the NFF board is in absolute grief. Chidi Okenwa was a loyal soldier of Nigeria football and was a leading member of our intellectual wing. This is a terrible blow. “He was one man you can always rely on to give candid advice. We bounced ideas off him regularly and picked his brain on many issues because of his wide knowledge and decades of experience in football administration. We will surely miss him,” Pinnick said. Brilliant, humble, eloquent, witty, thorough and committed to the development of Nigeria football at all levels, Hon. Okenwa evinced capacity, zeal and fervour, and gave his all for the good ending of any project or assignment in which he found himself.
