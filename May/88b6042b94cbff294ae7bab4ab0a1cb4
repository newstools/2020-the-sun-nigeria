Paris Saint-Germain is interested in signing Leicester’s Wilfred Ndidi, as they search for a new central midfielder in the summer transfer window, with Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey and Monaco’s Tiemoue Bakayoko also considered options, sources have told ESPN. Ndidi, 23, was in fine form for Champions League-chasing Leicester before the break due to the coronavirus outbreak and became the subject of interest from some top European clubs. And PSG, through the sporting director, Leonardo, is positioning themselves to make a move. The Nigeria international arrived at Leicester in 2017 from Genk for £15 million and still has another four years left on his contract. His value is estimated at around £45-50 million (N25million). Despite recently bringing in two central midfielders in Idrissa Gueye last summer for £30million from Everton and Leandro Paredes the previous January for £36million from Zenit, the Parisians still feel they need a strong and aggressive holding midfielder which neither the Senegal nor Argentina internationals are. Ndidi ticks all the boxes and Leonardo could soon accelerate on their interest.
