Gabriel Dike NO fewer than 78,127 candidates given provisional admission in 2019 by the tertiary institutions have not accepted the offer as at Sunday, May 3, 2020. The Joint Admissions Matriculation Board (JAMB) which released the list, said the affected candidates were offered provisional admission for 2019 admission exercise but have not accepted the offer. The 78,127 candidates were offered provisional admission by public and private universities, polytechnics, colleges of education, institutes, and vocational institutions. Among the courses offered the candidates include Medicine and Surgery, Pharmacy, Accounting, Mass Communication, Engineering, Economics, Political Science, Biochemistry, Nursing, education courses, English, Mechanical Engineering, and several programmes offered by polytechnics and colleges of education. Private universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education dominated the list of institutions while state universities had the largest candidates offered provisional admission for 2019 that are yet to accept the offer. The Education Report gathered that the affected candidates did not accept the admission offered by the institutions via the Central Admission Processing System (CAPS). The candidates were also expected to reject the offer but did not activate either of the two options. Other reasons include their inability to pay the high tuition fees for candidates offered admission by private institutions, some travelled out of the country and while others rejected the offered based on wrong course given to such candidates.
