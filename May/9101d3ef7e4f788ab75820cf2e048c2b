Archbishop Alfred Adewale  Martins  of the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos has  appealed to the Federal Government to allow traditional medicine practitioners use local herbs and  roots to cure  Coronavirus  pandemic currently ravaging the world. Martins made the appeal during a news conference held  at the Holy Cross Cathedral hall  in  Lagos yesterday, ahead of the  commemoration of the forthcoming  54th World Communications Day. He said traditional herbal medicines had their  own healing effects, pleading with  the government to give credence to  their producers  for them to use the products as  cure for the virus. “Herbal medicine  has its healing effect and I think it is important  that government gives local practitioners and researchers opportunities  to research into  the use of  our local  herbal roots  and come up with remedies from them  for this Coronavirus pandemic. “We have heard  these  local remedies curing different types of diseases  before, and it is only appropriate that they are given a chance to prove their efficacy at this point in time. “We understand that there is the need for test and validation of local herbs. Madagascar has developed its own  and was embraced by the Federal Government. “That has created the urgency for our government to pay attention to the development and promotion of our own indigenous herbal products and  remedies offered by others that will lead to an  end  to COVID-19 pandemic in our country,” he said.
