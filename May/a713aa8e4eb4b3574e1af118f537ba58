The six patients, who have since joined their families to continue living their normal lives, bring the total number of discharged cases in Ogun to 20. However, four new confirmed cases were announced in the state by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, yesterday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 95. Of these 95, there are currently 73 active cases who are receiving specialised care in isolation centres within the state.
