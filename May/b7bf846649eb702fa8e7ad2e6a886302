This festival strives to bridge cultures through films by inviting a diverse audience to celebrate some of the best films from and about the African continent. TAFF 2020 attendees will be treated to an exploration of the African continent through the global lens and voices of talented filmmakers. This edition will be accessible worldwide,” he explained. A filmmaker and software engineer, Eke stated further that guests for this year’s festival will have the privilege of watching the film selections in the comfort of their homes as well as on demand, adding that a film portal, Rootflix will showcase the selected films and award ceremony. On the decision to host this year’s edition online, Eke said: “There was a desire to reschedule the event due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we opted to host it online and stream it globally. With so much uncertainly amid COVID-19, and since no one can accurately predict when it might actually be possible to host the event in a safe and responsible manner, hence the decision to host it online.”
