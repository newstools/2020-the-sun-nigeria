Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Indications have emerged that worship centres in Ondo State may open anytime from now. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu gave the indication in a chat with newsmen in Akure, the state capital. The governor said he would meet with religious leaders and other stakeholders in the state on how to open the worship centres. Akeredolu promised to accelerate the consultations and review after which “the people will hear from me very soon.” He said out of the 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 13 have been discharged, one died and six currently receiving treatment. Akeredolu said the data showed Ondo health workers were competent and ready to save lives. He noted that his greatest concerns were inter-state importation and community transmission of COVID-19. Also, Akeredolu said massive contact tracing has begun for the 20th case recorded as the patient has been resident in the state. “The implication is that having been infected, she might also have come in contact with others thereby enlarging the circle. This is what community transmission means. It is dangerous, deadly and undesirable. We must therefore collaborate to stop the threat. “I wish to admonish all residents of Ondo State to remain vigilant and dedicate themselves to community care by reporting all suspicions to our health workers and our rapid response team available on the specially designated toll-free numbers,” he said.
