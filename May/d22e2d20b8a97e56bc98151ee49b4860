Now, the two boxing legends were now set to stun the world again by making their comebacks to the ring years after retiring. And when joined by NBA legend, Dennis Rodman on his podcast, Tyson revealed he has no regrets about the incident – and claimed he made even more than his hefty fine. “I never even think about it,” Tyson said. Rodman was a guest on Mike Tyson’s podcast and talked about his colourful life and excellent basketball career “However, I think about how much money that I made from taking pictures of biting people that it supersedes the $3m that I lost. “That’s what it makes it funny for me. Yes, I bit his ear, but I made that back from taking pictures. “So I can never beat myself up about it. I always say to my children: ‘Damn we’re born, we’ve got this amount of time before we die – what are we gonna do?”
