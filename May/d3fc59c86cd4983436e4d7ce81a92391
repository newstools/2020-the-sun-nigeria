In line with his commitment to ensuring that players in dire need are given assistance, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare yesterday gave financial lifeline to ailing former Super Eagles defender, Sunday Eboigbe. Following his outcry in a national paper that he was sick and in need of support, the minister directed one of his aides, Mr. Ogunjimi to trace Eboigbe and hand over cash gift to assist him. Ogunjimi visited the ex player in his Benin City abode and handed him the cash gift from the minister yesterday. According to the ministerâ€™s aide, the gesture would not end with just the cash gift, but the ex international would be given needed medical assistance after proper evaluation. The state of his ailment would be assessed by medics, with the aim of giving him proper treatment to be paid for by the minister. The ministry had written to the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) to come up with a welfare package that would take care of ex internationals that are either sick or injured. Dare had extended similar assistance to the mothers of late Rashidi Yekini, Samuel Okwaraji and quarter-miler, Sunday Bada.
