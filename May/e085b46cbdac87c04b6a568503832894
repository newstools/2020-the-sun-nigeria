To him, apart from seeking to update the laws governing banks and banking services, the bill would also enhance efficiency in the process of granting banking licences in the country. “In addition, the Bill also stipulates stiffer penalties for infractions in the financial sector and seeks to clarify the functions of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the financial system.” “The Bill also seeks the regulation of FINTECHs (Financial Technology Companies) in the country”, he added. He thanked the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, and other distinguished colleagues for their support, hoping for “a quick passage of the important bill.”
