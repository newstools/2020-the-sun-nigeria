The promoter of Freestyle Football in Africa, Feet ‘N’ Tricks International, has unveiled the maiden edition of the Freestyle UNLOCKED Africa 2020 championship which is first of its kind on the continent. Chairman of Feet ‘N’ Tricks International, Valentine Ozigbo, in the company’s first virtual press conference held via  Zoom, revealed that the championship is going to be online and packed with prizes and surprises to “develop and nurture an art, a lifestyle, and a passion for many.” Freestyle UNLOCKED Africa 2020 is the fourth installment of  the annual football freestyle event. Ozigbo, speaking in Lagos, said: “We will not stop till an African emerges the World Champion, and we host the World Freestyle Football Championships in Nigeria and, who knows, it might even be in my home state of Anambra.” While noting that the world was going through a difficult time owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, he  explained that his passion for the development of the freestyle genre of football spurred him to find a way past the pandemic in order to continue a tradition which had become his passion. Ozigbo  further stated that while most other sports had shut or scaled down, freestyle football can go on very easily in a non-contact manner to respect the physical distancing rules.
