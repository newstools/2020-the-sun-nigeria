Reacting to the performance of the market, analysts, who spoke with Daily Sun, said the market recorded its lowest weekly traded value and volume in 2020 due to the fact that there has been cautious dealings by both retail and institutional clients. They, however, remained optimistic that the market would see some form of bargain hunting when transactions resume today. Afrinvest, in their weekly assesment of the market, said, “In the coming week, we anticipate a mixed performance as investors react to more corporate earnings releases. Additionally, we expect to see some bargain hunting activities in early trades of this week”. A stockbroker, who craved anonymity said, “While we believe the risk-off sentiment could have caused the recent sell-off in the market, we retain our stance that this may be one of the best periods to pick up some quality names with a medium to long term horizon”. For their part, Cordros Capital, said, “in our opinion, risks remain on the horizon due to a combination of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria and weak economic conditions. Thus, we continue to advise investors to trade cautiously and seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks.
