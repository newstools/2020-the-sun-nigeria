The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control has said people within the 31 to 40 years age bracket are more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus in the country. According to the centre, however, more deaths have been recorded among older people of 60 years and above. In a report in Abuja yesterday, the NCDC said that data also showed that men were two times more likely to get the virus as shown in its latest demographic data on COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths by gender and age in the country. “(People) between 31 and 40 years (of age) have the highest rate of confirmed cases. More males in that age category are confirmed cases but with lower mortality rate. Age 31-40: Male – 797 infected with seven deaths, female – 324 with four deaths but lower mortality compared to older persons,” it said. The report said, in spite of this, older people die more due to several factors from co-morbidities. The data showed more deaths among 61 to 70-year-olds, though the lowest rate in confirmed cases. “Ages 61 to 70: Male, 188 infected with three deaths, Female, 52 infected with four deaths. Age 70 plus: Male, 74 infected with 12 deaths, female, 33 infected with five deaths. Highest rate of mortality, comparable to global data.” The report also showed a very high rate of mortality among ages 41 to 50 and 51 to 60: “Ages 41 to 50: Male, 570 infected with 15 deaths, Female, 206 infected with four deaths. Ages 51 to 60: Male, 364 infected with 27 deaths, Female, I48 infected with three deaths.” Meanwhile, 11- to 20-year-olds were infected, with three deaths and under 10 also were infected at lower rates, with one death, which was also a male.
