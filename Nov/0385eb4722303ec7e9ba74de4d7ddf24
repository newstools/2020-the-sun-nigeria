An accident, which involved a Mercedes Benz truck and a motorcycle near the Ota toll gate in Ogun, on Wednesday, has claimed a life. Mr Adekunle Ajibade, the Sango-Ota Area Commander of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE), told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that apart from the commercial motorcyclist who died, his two passengers sustained injuries in the accident which occurred on Ilo-awela road at about 8:10 p.m. He disclosed that the truck driver drove against the traffic and in the process hit the motorcycle which was coming from the opposite direction. “The corpse of the motorcycle rider had been deposited at the Ifo General Hospital morgue while the injured were taken to hospitals in Ota for intensive treatment,’’ he said. Ajibade said that both the truck and the motorcycle had been removed from the scene of the accident to ease the free flow of traffic in the area. He advised motorists not to drive against traffic to avoid “unnecessary loss of lives“. (NAN)
