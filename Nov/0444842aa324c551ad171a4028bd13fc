The 21st edition of the show had been billed to hold on 12 April but was postponed indefinitely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chief Executive Officer, Flykite Productions, Jenkins Alumona, expressed delight at the lifting of restrictions on contact sports but stated that every measure necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19 will be taken. “We’re happy that the Coronavirus-induced restrictions on sporting activities, especially on contact sports, have been lifted. But we’re aware that the virus is still raging, the reason we’re holding this edition behind closed doors. The event will be live on SuperSport in 50 African countries and fans can be assured of seeing the best of Nigerian boxing,” said Alumona.
