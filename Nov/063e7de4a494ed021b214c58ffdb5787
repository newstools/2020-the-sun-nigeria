(Reuters/NAN) Ferran Torres, Gabriel Jesus and Joao Cancelo were on target as Manchester City made it three wins out of three in UEFA Champions League Group C. They secured a 3-0 win over Olympiakos at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday. Torres put Manchester City ahead after 12 minutes, playing a smart one-two with Kevin De Bruyne before confidently slotting home for his third goal in as many games in the competition. Raheem Sterling had the ball in the net in the 32nd minute, but his effort was ruled out for offside, as Manchester City dominated play. But the Greek side grew into the game after the break. The visitors should have drawn level in the 55th minute when a sloppy pass from Phil Foden fell to Mathieu Valbuena, but the 36-year-old French winger miscued his shot. While the Greek side rarely threatened, Manchester City needed another goal to ease their nerves and it came from substitute Gabriel Jesus in the 81st minute. The Brazilian hammered a shot in from close range at the near post after being slipped in by De Bruyne. Defender Joao Cancelo made sure of the points in the 90th minute with a well-placed shot from outside of the area. It all leaves Manchester City in a commanding position at the top of the group.
