Tony John, Port Harcourt Gunmen suspected to be cultists have shot dead a member of Khana Security and Peace Advisory Committee (KHASPAC) identified as Sari in Bori, Rivers State. KHASPAC is a local vigilance group in Khana Local Government Area of the state. The killing was confirmed by a member of KHASPAC, who gave his name as Christopher. Christopher disclosed that they were together with the deceased before he left for the motor park, in Bori, headquarters of Khana LGA, where he met his untimely death. He said that few minutes after Saro had left his colleagues, they heard gunshots and when they rushed to the scene, they saw the victim lying in a pool of his blood. The source disclosed that people at the scene recognised some of the killers, who are from the same community with the deceased. Daily Sun gathered that Saro, who hailed from Luawii community in Khana LGA, was reportedly shot dead at night opposite the main motor park in Bori. KHASPAC, according to community sources, is dreaded by criminals because the members are believed to possess potent charm, which makes it impossible for bullet to penetrate their body. When Daily Sun contacted the state police public relations officer, Nnamdi Omoni, a Superintendent of Police, to confirm the killing, he replied through a text message, saying: “Yet to get the report. I will call you later please.”
