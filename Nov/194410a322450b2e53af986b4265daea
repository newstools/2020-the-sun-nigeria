Uche Usim, Abuja The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) is proposing the establishment of the African Centre for Deposit Insurance (ACDI) to be domiciled in its NDIC Academy, Abuja to provide training and enhance the capacity of staff of member countries on the continent.

Members also commended the proposed ARC Publication which is designed to document the experiences and challenges of Deposit Insurance System (DIS) in Africa. They agreed for the setting up of a Committee made up of Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya and Morocco to coordinate the collation of information from member countries to be used in the compilation of the publication. During the meeting, ARC member countries provided update on their activities. Issues discussed from the country reports centred on the need for continuous capacity building; enhanced public awareness; prompt depositor Reimbursement/pay-out; and stepping-up of supervision of insured institutions.
