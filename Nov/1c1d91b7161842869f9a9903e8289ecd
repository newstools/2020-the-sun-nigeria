Submission of entries will be done using the online portal. The jurors who will be working remotely, will judge each category online through the portal. “We are pleased to be able to reward creative excellence within the industry. Every year, we recognise advertising creatives. This year, we will also be rewarding creative ideas of individuals within and outside the industry who are willing to participate in this year’s awards,” said Adisa The Association is working on a jury selection that is representative of the industry to ensure fairness and balance in assessing entries. Selected jurors will be announced at a later date.
