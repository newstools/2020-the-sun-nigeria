Magnus Eze, Enugu Traditional rulers, youths and other stakeholders in Enugu State have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to as a matter of priority work out modalities for the implementation of the resolutions of the 2014 National Conference with a view to restructuring the country. They spoke at a parley called by Minister of Foreign Affairs; Geoffrey Onyeama, at the instance of the president, to resolve pending issues relating to the just concluded #EndSARS protest by the youths. Onyeama said the President was committed to reforming the police as well as putting the country on the path of sustainable growth. He stated that having moved round to assess the extent of damage on private and public utilities as well as the loss of lives recorded during the protests, “we are the losers.” Speakers after speakers harped on the need for the country to be restructured in order to get the best out of the various peoples of Nigeria. The traditional ruler of Oduma community, Igwe Godwin Nwanjoku, said that the need for a full restructure of the country had become more compelling following the events of the past few weeks. He regretted that a peaceful protest against police brutality turned violent. However, he said that the development showed how frustrated Nigerians had grown about the quality of governance. The monarch said that the only way to avert future occurrence of such ugly development was to restructure and cede more responsibilities to the various federating units that would emerge. “We appreciate President Muhammadu Buhari for making this type of interaction which is the first of its kind possible. “However, we want those who work closely with him to advise him to look into the report of the National Confab of 2014 and implement it to avoid future occurrence of this type of protest,” Nwanjoku said.
