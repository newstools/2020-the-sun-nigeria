ROGER FEDERER is back on a tennis court and eyeing his 2021 comeback after recovering from two knee surgeries. The Swiss great, who turned 39 in August, took to social media to give fans a positive update as he continues his return to full fitness. Federer shared a picture from his homeland serving on a court surrounded by trees. He wrote: “Back to work,” and tagged his coach Severin Luthi. Luthi then shared a picture of his man striking a trademark forehand on the week he reached 1,000 weeks in the ATP’s top 20. He added: “Great week of practice with @rogerfederer outdoors in Switzerland in November!” Federer has not played a competitive tennis match since losing the Australian Open semi-final to Novak Djokovic in January. He went under the knife in February for arthroscopic treatment on a problematic right knee but then needed an additional operation three months later.
