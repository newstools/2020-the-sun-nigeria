Rose Ejembi, Makurdi Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has again dispelled rumour that he intends to dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and join the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement signed his his Chief Press Secretary Terver Akase and made available to Daily Sun on Thursday evening, Governor Ortom described the rumour as mischievous stating that those involved in the impish allegation are clearly doing so to soothe their stuck-up apprehensions. “We have read some mischievous statements by members of the opposition in Benue State insinuating that Governor Samuel Ortom plans to rejoin All Progressives Congress, APC. “Why will Governor Ortom return to APC? To do what? It is true that the Governor was contacted by some notable persons to defect from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but he declined the invitation. “Governor Ortom is the leader of PDP in North Central Nigeria, and he is enjoying a robust relationship with other leaders of the party in Benue State and the entire region. It is therefore ridiculous for anyone to insinuate that the Governor has the intention to leave PDP.” Akase advised young men who have been peddling the hang-about rumour to take advantage of the numerous entrepreneurial opportunities the Ortom administration has created through its collaboration with Bank of Industry, Bank of Agriculture and other financial institutions to engage in rewarding ventures and shun falsehood.
