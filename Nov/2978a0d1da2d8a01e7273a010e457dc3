Rose Ejembi, Makurdi, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Sola Ojo, Kaduna Archbishop of Abuja Catholic Diocese, Ignatius Kaigama, has expressed the hope that the protests  would awaken political will in leaders and in everyone who should do something about it. The cleric, who stated this during the homily at the celebration of 90th anniversary of Holy Ghost parish Makurdi, Benue State, yesterday, explained that the youths have again highlighted what the Catholic Bishop conference have been talking about. “Let us not pretend that there is no problem in the country. Let us not behave like the Ostrich that buries its head in the sand and behave like there is no danger. There is danger. The brutality we are suffering in the hands of the police was enough and the youths have said it.” He noted Catholic conference had been stressing the need for all Nigerians to stop corruption so that the wealth of the nation could go round. “We kept saying that but they didn’t listen. Now, the youths have said it. I hope it will wake us all up and I hope that the next political dispensation will be a different one.” The Archbishop, who lamented that the peaceful protest was hijacked at a point with killings and , however, urged the youths to continue to be peaceful in their protests and not allow the bad eggs among them destroy what they started. He expressed optimism that the change they earnestly desire will come at the right time, saying: “This world is not our home we have little time here so let us use the little time to embrace ourselves and embrace peace. Force won’t bring peace. Blessed are the peace makers for they shall be called sons and daughters of God. Let us embrace peace so we can see God.” He appealed to parishioners to continue to support Bishop Wilfred Anagbe, Bishop of Makurdi Diocese and the Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Moses Iorapuu, in building the church and spreading the gospel. The event witnessed the confirmation of over 200 candidates for the Sacrament by Bishop Wilfred Anagbe who urged them to be active members and contribute to the growth of the church.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
