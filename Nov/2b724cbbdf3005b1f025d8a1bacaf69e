Bolaji Okunola One of Africa most successful footballer, Samuel Eto’o has tipped Nigerian Victor Osimhen for greatness despite his inability to justify his €70million record transfer from French club, Lille, to Italian outfit, Napoli, so far.  Eto’o, in an interview session shared on Instagram by Osimhen’s acclaimed spokesman, Oma Akatugba, stated the 21-year-old has what it takes to succeed despite receiving his first career red during the midweek UEFA Europa league outing against host, Real Sociadad. In the 50 seconds video, the Cameroonian was seen urging the lanky striker never to give up in his ambition to attain an enviable height. “Osimhen is playing for one of the best teams in Italy and his happiness will be the happiness of all Africans. He is a very fast player with great technique, and he is very accurate in front of goal. He has a coach who has a lot of character. I see him becoming the unique player that  Africans hope he can become. “Now it’s up to him to search for the respect he deserves. He needs to work everyday. The dream is the beginning of every success and every project, I hope he maintains his form,” Eto’o stated. Osimhen, who has netted a single goal since joining the Italian giant, will continue his struggle against visiting team, Sassuolo, today.
