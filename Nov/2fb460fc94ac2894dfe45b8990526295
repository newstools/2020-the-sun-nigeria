Leading sports production and marketing company, HotSports Nigeria Ltd has finalised plans to formally welcome back former Super Eagles media officer, Toyin Ibitoye. After a five-and-a-half-year hiatus from active sports journalism, Ibitoye returned to the beat last week following his completion of an acclaimed and highly successful tour of duty. The event slated for Studio 2 inside the company’s complex in Ikeja, Lagos takes place on Sunday, with Taye Ige, President/CEO assisted by top officials of the company leading the party. Expected to grace the event would be Ibitoye’s friends and family members, top officials of the Nigerian Football Federation and other leading lights of the football confraternity in Nigeria, sports editors and managers of Nigerian newspapers and programmes on radio and television. In a release he personally signed yesterday, Ige said “On behalf of the Teams at both HotSports Nigeria Ltd & HS Studios, I wish to extend my heartfelt salutation and congratulations to our colleague, Toyin Ibitoye on the successful completion of his tour of duty. “Relevant members of the HotSports Team and I would like to recall, with immense gratitude, how pleasurable it was working with you in the last five-and-a-half years especially during our several activations in furtherance of our roles as both the official media partner as well as marketing consultant to the Nigeria Football Federation. We all know how difficult access to the national team camp can sometimes be. This became significantly easy for us to achieve under your watch, making both our editorial and marketing activation responsibilities much easier to carry out. It has thus been a privilege working with you and now it’s an honour to celebrate the legacy of hard work and exceptional dedication to duty you have left behind for your successor.”
