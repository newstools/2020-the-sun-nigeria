Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 1.72 per cent to end at 23,695.23 after rising as much as 2.16 per cent in the morning. The broader Topix index was up 1.2 per cent to 1,627.25 on the day. Japanese financial markets were closed on Tuesday for a public holiday.

Such as his plan to raise some taxes, while he would favour a larger stimulus package to bolster the pandemic-battered economy.
