The management of Lagos State Signage and Advertising Agency (LASAA) has stated that it remains the sole authority in charge of regulation of outdoor advertising and signages in the state contrary to the spurious claim of a notable Lagos politician that Loatsad Media regulates and controls the erection of billboards and signages in Lagos. Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO) of LASAA, Prince Adedamola Docemo, in a statement issued by the agency yesterday, said there was no iota of truth in an interview granted to Arise TV recently by a former military governor of Ondo State and chieftain of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bode George, claiming that Loatsad Media now regulates and controls erection of billboards and signages in Lagos. Prince Docemo explained that Loatsad Media Limited, owned by Mr Seyi Tinubu, was one of the companies that had subjected themselves to the rigorous process of registration with LASAA alongside over 200 other practitioners in the outdoor advertising space in the state.
