It said, “Sequel to the COVID-19 pandemic, the viability of the external sector in 2020 is expected to deteriorate, given the present worsening current account balance and depletion of external reserves driven, largely, by decelerating export receipts, particularly oil. Specifically, the degree of external reserves accumulation is expected to decelerate, as outflows are expected to outweigh inflows. As a result, it said, external reserves were expected to lie between $29.9billion and $34.3billionbillion at end-December 2020 (predicated on current declining oil price between $20 and $40).
