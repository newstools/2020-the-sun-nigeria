Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River has commiserated with former Senate Majority Leader, Mr Victor Ndoma-Egba over the death of his wife, Mrs Amaka Ndoma-Egba.
This is contained in a statement by his Special Adviser, Media and Publicity, Mr Christian Ita, on Saturday in Calabar.
Ayade expressed deep over Amaka’s sudden transition adding that her demise was yet another vissicitude to befall the former Senate Leader in recent times.
“Dear Victor, the death of your dear wife is a severe blow on all of us who knew her, and a harder blow on you as her husband, friend and confidant.
“Words cannot adequately convey my heartfelt sorrow over Amaka’s death, for she was a kind and beautiful soul who spread love to all who encountered her,” he said.
The governor, however, urged Sen. Ndoma-Egba and his family to be consoled by the fact that the deceased selflessly and fervently served God and humanity during her salutary and impactful life on earth.
While praying God to give Ndoma-Egba the fortitude to bear the loss, Ayade prayed God to grant her sole eternal peace.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Amaka died on Nov. 20, 2020 after an auto crash on Benin-Akure Expressway. (NAN)
