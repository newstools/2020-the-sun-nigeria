Aloysius Attah, Onitsha A chieftain of All Progressive Congress (APC) in Anambra State, Chief Kingsley Nzomiwu, has urged the southeast zone to give support to the ruling party as well as policies of the Buhari administration in order to ensure support for president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Nzomiwu threw this charge in Ozubulu community, Ekwusigo LGA, during the distribution of another round of palliatives to widows from the area. He said contrary to the views held by some uninformed persons, President Buhari had embarked on developmental projects in the Southeast which would stand the test of time. He described President Muhammadu Buhari as the most friendly president to the Igbo in terms of development. According to him, some of the enduring projects of the administration include the second Niger Bridge, completion of Zikâ€™s Mausoleum, remodeling of the Akanu Ibiam Airport, Enugu, construction of Enugu-Onitsha road, among others. However, while noting the perceived marginalization of the Igbo in federal appointments, he urged the president to do more in order to assuage the feeling of the people of Southeast and give them a sense of belonging.
