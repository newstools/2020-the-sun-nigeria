The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN)  has said the permit granted to Dangote, BUA, and an unnamed gas firm to transport their products through the land borders is a step in the right direction,  as it shows that the border is about to be reopened. Acting Director General,  Mr Oruche who made the assertion, in response  to the outcry of Nigerians who queried  Federal Government’s decision on the waiver, noted that  the move was a pointer that more companies will soon be permitted. Oruche  believes that the permit given to these companies was not discriminatory  as widely believed, noting that it is a test run, which is part  of the process to see to the broader reopening of  the border. “With this,  we will be able to know how it will work. If they see how this  one plays out, they will be able to know how it will work and then proceed to do the needful,  adding that the closure is not a sustainable thing. According  to him,  the circular sent to him from the Nigerian Customs Service, shows thayt only cement would be exported across the border, with the trucks returning empty without importing any goods. However, before the trucks cross the border, the names of the drivers and the registration  numbers of the trucks would be taken. “From the  circular, only cement can be exported and no other products. I think due to the heavy nature of cement , which cannot be transported  by air or sea is one of the reasons for the permit.
