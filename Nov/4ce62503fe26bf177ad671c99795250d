According to the La Repubblica via Area Napoli, Victor Osimhen regrets being sent off in the closing minutes of Napoli’s 1-0 win at Real Socidead in a Europa League game on Thursday. The Nigeria international joined the fray in the 61st minute, was penalised for a foul on Real Sociedad winger Ander Barrenetxea with nine minutes left on the clock, and was given his marching orders to leave the pitch for a second yellow card in the second minute of stoppage time after a foul on Le Normand. Osimhen has apologized to Gennaro Gattuso and his teammates and has vowed to do everything possible to help Napoli register a win in this evening’s Serie A game against Sassuolo. The 21-year-old is aware that it is difficult playing against defensive-minded teams and wants to avoid the mistake that led to his sending off against Real Sociedad. Though he is suspended in Europe, the Super Eagle is in the frame to make his fourth start in the Italian top-flight at the Stadio San Paolo. The former Wolfsburg and Lille youngster has managed one goal from six appearances across all competitions.
