Spartak Moscow’s General Director, Shamil Gazizov, has called Victor Moses’ fitness to question Speaking after Spartak Moscow’s 1-0 loss to Rostov in the Russian Premier League on Saturday, the general director thinks Moses is not yet in tip-top condition in terms of his fitness. Before the former Nigeria international moved to Spartak, he was frozen out of the first-team setup at Chelsea and was made to train with the loan group and development squad. In truth, Moses could be having fitness issues as his last competitive appearance before his move to Russia was against Sevilla in the Europa League final on August 21. Spartak coach Domenico Tedesco is gradually introducing the Nigerian into the squad, handing him his debut off the bench vs Khimki and he didn’t complete the following games against Krasnodar and Rostov. Asked to comment on the percentage of Moses’ fitness, Gazizov told Sport Express: “I will not rate it as a percentage. I see that Victor is not yet fully ready, but it is clear that he shows a high class of the game. “I think that today he played very well, as far as his physical readiness allows. At least I can see it. Let the following experts discuss and speak.” Spartak Moscow have an obligation to buy Moses if they qualify for next season’s Champions League and the winger features in a certain number of games.
