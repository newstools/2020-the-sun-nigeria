Paul Osuyi, Asaba Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has said President Muhammadu Buhari did not sign the Electoral Amendment Act before the 2019 general election for political reasons. The governor blamed politicians their selfishness in avoiding actions that would in the long run undermine their personal interests and to the detriment of the common good. He, however, expressed optimism that the Electoral Act would be signed this time around. His words: “The Electoral Act was not signed because of politics, politicians are selfish. If you watch what is going on in America, President Donald Trump does not want the mailing votes to be counted if they arrive after 8pm on election day. But members of the Democratic Party think otherwise. “That is the way of politicians, always be conscious to avoid taking actions and decisions that would undo you. So it was not signed because of politics but I know that it will be signed this time.” The governor spoke in Asaba while addressing youths in Delta North at a town hall meeting following the #EndSARS protests across the country and it’s subsequent hijack by aggrieved youths. Okowa told the youths that politics was about learning along the line and picking the good things seen in good politicians and throwing away the bad ideas. “I agree that there is need to re-work our electoral processes but we need to re-engineer our minds because we have lost it and it’s time we began to talk to ourselves,” he said.
