Eziomume Solomon, Nnewi Ohanaeze Ndigbo has called on Igbo businessmen and women to repatriate some of their businesses home in order to create job opportunities for the teeming school leavers in Igbo land. President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Anambra State chapter, Damian Okeke Ogene, who stated this lamented the situation where top Igbo industrialists site their businesses and industries outside their home, thereby denying their own people employment opportunities, and their governments the internally generated revenue to help provide social amenities. He made the submission during the presentation of a biography titled: “Sir Joseph Chimezie Nwakpadolu: His vision and achievements,” written by an Anglican priest, Revd C.O.G Oragu. He said: “We are here today to present a biography of a foremost industrialist of Igbo extraction, Sir Joseph Nwakpadolu. He was one of the very few individuals, who answered the clarion call of the first executive governor of Anambra State, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife, who called on indigenes of the state to repatriate their industries home. New generation of Igbo industrialists must emulate this man, and bring parts of their businesses home.”
