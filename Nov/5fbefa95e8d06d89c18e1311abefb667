The Defence Headquarters said the troops of Operation Fire Ball have overrun some Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists and arrested their Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) makers in the North East. The acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brigadier-General Benard Onyeuko, disclosed this in a statement yesterday. He said that the troops operating under Operation Lafiya Dole have continued aggressive clearance operations to identified terroristsâ€™ enclaves. Onyeuko said the troops on November 11 embarked on an aggressive fighting patrol to clear Boko Haram elements in their hideout in Ladantar village in Borno following a credible intelligence. He said the troops subsequently engaged the terrorists with an overwhelming firepower.
