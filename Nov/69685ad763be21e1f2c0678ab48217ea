Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) has summoned the suspended Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, directing him to appear before it on November 17, with documents of all his landed properties. Magu is currently under probe by the presidential panel of inquiry headed by a former president of the Court of Appeal, Justice Ayo Salami (Retd). This is coming on the heels of Magu’s suspension from office by President Muhammadu Buhari following corruption allegations brought against him by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN. The allegations against him border on abuse of office and mismanagement of Federal Government recovered assets and finances from May 2015 to May 2020. In addition, Magu was among other things, accused by the AGF of “not acting in the overall best interest of the country”. In the said petition, Malami insisted that in the EFCC under Magu, there was “mismanagement and lack of transparency in managing recovered assets; diversion of recovered assets for personal enrichment”. He further accused Magu of “neglecting to investigate the P&ID case as directed by the President; flagrant disobedience to directives and to court orders due to the following; final report of the presidential committee on audit of recovered assets (PCARA); mismanagement and lack of transparency in managing recovered assets”. Magu had since appeared before the panel and denied all allegations against him. While the Salami panel is yet to submit his report, Magu has however found himself in another trouble with the CCB. In a letter that was signed by its Director of Intelligence, Investigation & Monitoring, Gwimi S. P,  the CCB equally directed Magu to produce acknowledgement slips of all the asset declarations he made since he joined public service. It stressed that all the requested documents must be the Certified True Copies, CTC. Other documents the ousted EFCC boss was ordered to make available to the Bureau, include copies of his Appointment Letter, Acceptance, Records of Service and Pay Slips from January to May, 2020. The CCB, in the invitation letter dated November 2, a copy of which was sighted by Saturday Sun on Friday, stressed that Magu should provide documents pertaining to both his developed and undeveloped landed properties. The Bureau said it has launched investigation into a case of alleged breach of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers, brought against Magu. The letter reads: “The Bureau is investigating a case of alleged breach of Code of Conduct for Public Officer against Mr. Ibrahim Mustapha Magu, the former Acting Chairman, Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “In view of the foregoing, you are invited for an interview scheduled an follows: Date: Tuesday 17 November, 2020.
