Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to listen to the voices of prominent Nigerians seeking restructuring or risk being responsible for the  imminent break-up of Nigeria. Adams said with the  present situation in the country, there were  signals  that Nigeria might not last beyond 2023. At a special thanksgiving service  held to celebrate his birthday in Lagos, at the Saviour’s Ministries C & S Worldwide, Cathedral National Headquarter, Alausa Ikeja, Adams reiterated the need for restructuring, lamenting that Nigeria is due for total overhaul. He also blamed the  sudden increase in the price of the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol as wickedness of the leaders to the plights of Nigerians, saying suffering associated with increasing price of petrol was uncalled-for, describing it as an attempt to suffer the mass of the people. “Nigerians are hungry and angry. We cannot continue like this. The pain is becoming too much. For instance, the #EndSARS struggle was a testimony of  the protracted suffering of Nigerians, but the truth still remains that until we restructure this country by adopting the popular regionalism, we will continue to suffer and make no headway,” he said   Click Here>>>>>>Anti-kidnap and anti-theft device for tracking and listening<<<<<<
