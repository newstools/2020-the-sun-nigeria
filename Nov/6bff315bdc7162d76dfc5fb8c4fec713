Robbers in the early hours of Wednesday reportedly broke into the Abia apartment of a reporter for The Sun Newspaper, Mr Okey Sampson, making away with his laptop, phones, those of his children and other valuables. Mr Sampson said he returned from Umuahia on official assignment on Tuesday night and had used the laptop and phones to write stories he had planned to send to Lagos the following day. Having worked late in the night, Mr Sampson said he left the laptop, his phones and those of his children in the sitting room and went to sleep. The Sun Abia correspondent said he had hardly retired to bed than he heard noises within the compound. He said by the time he rushed out to investigate, he found out his sitting-room was broken into by hoodlums who made away with some valuables including laptop and phones. A few months ago, the home of another journalist residing in Aba, Mr Ugochukwu Alaribe of the Vanguard Newspapers, was raided by hoodlums, carting away valuable items.
