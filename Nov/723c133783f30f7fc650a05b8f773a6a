Okey Sampson, Umuahia Barely one week after the end of the #EndSARS protests in which two policemen were killed and equally two police stations burnt in Aba, Abia State, some police officers in the commercial city, have accused the Aba area commander, Kabiru Ibrahim of negligence. Ibrahim has denied that, saying the allegation was the handiwork of few disgruntled officers who may not have been in Aba during the protest or were out for mischief. Some officers under the aegis of Concerned Police Officers (CPO) in Aba said police in the city were taken unawares by the protest as the area commander could not gather intelligence on time and pass same down the line. The officers equally accused Ibrahim of not coordinating policemen under his control well, stating that on the day of the incident, the area commander could not inform most Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) of the coming catastrophe. They were of the opinion that if the area commander had informed the DPOs of the protest earlier, the officers could have done everything possible to ensure the human and materials losses the police incurred in the city could have been minimized.
