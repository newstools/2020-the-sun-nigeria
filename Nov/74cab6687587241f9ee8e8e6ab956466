Senator representing Enugu North, Chukwuka Utazi and traditional ruler of Nkpologu community, Igwe Simeon J. Idu, have thanked Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State, for numerous landmark development projects in Uzo-Uwani Local Government Area. Speaking when Senator Utazi received the governor in his country home in Nkpologu, Igwe Idu thanked Ugwuanyi for the ongoing work on the long-neglected 39km Umulokpa-Adaba-Ukpata-Uvuru-Nkpologu road which linked many communities of Uzo-Uwani LGA to their headquarters at Umulokpa. “Before now, we have not gone to our headquarters in Umulokpa without passing through four local government areas of Nsukka, Igbo-Etiti, Udi and Ezeagu,” he said. Igwe Idu also thanked Governor Ugwuanyi for asphalting the 26.665km Ukpabi-Nimbo-Ugbene Ajima-Eziani road as well as the Edem Ani-Urobo-Abbi road. Senator Utazi said the governor’s achievements in infrastructural development in Uzo-Uwani LGA were unprecedented and commendable. The federal lawmaker disclosed that Governor Ugwuanyi’s administration had executed “the longest earth road in Enugu State” in the council area and reassured him that they would  not take such considerations for granted.
