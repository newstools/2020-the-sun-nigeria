Laide Raheem, Abeokuta Managent of Dangote Cement Plant, Ibese, Ogun State, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with youths of Ibese, Ilaro and adjoining host communities, to improve its community relations by fulfilling its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and engaging more qualified youths from the communities. The cement company also agreed to empower youths through various skills acquisition programmes, aimed at creating entrepreneurs in the host communities. The signing of the MoU followed agitations by the Ibese and Ilaro youths that the company had failed to fulfil its CSR, especially on environment development. Briefing newsmen after a meeting between the representatives of Dangote Cement and leadership of Yewa Youth Development Forum, Ilaro, at the weekend, the Ogun State Commissioner for Environment, Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, said the meeting had become imperative to douse tension and foster relationship between the company and youths of the host communities. The Commissioner said that the study of the Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA) report and CSR plans of the company showed that it adequately captured development plans for the host communities, urging the cement plant to constantly avail the youths with its CSR activities. He added that the state government decided to broker a ‘peace’ meeting between the youths and the company so as to forstall the breakdown of law and order in the axis, noting that the meeting jointly agreed to work towards ensuring a peaceful environment through eight resolutions agreed by all parties present. “The engagement today is premised on Yewa youths, basically in line with CSR that should be embarked upon by Dangote in line with the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the company. The EIA I have with me shows that the company has actually complied.
