Meanwhile, minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu has appealed to youths across the country to give time to allow government implement their requests, adding that President Buhari was committed to implementing all the five-point demands made during the protest. Onu made the call in Abakaliki when he visited the family of a 300 level medical student (Favour Sopuruchi Omoha) who was hit by a stray bullet in the head during the protests. He said  Buhari was interested in leaving behind a country that young people will be proud of and urged them to shun violence as the destruction of the country’s national assets was not in the interest of anybody. He thanked God for saving the life of the young medical student even as he made financial donation for the upkeep of the victim. “We are here to thank God she is quickly recovering. We are very confident that our doctor did their best. The injury is on her head. All those EndSARS youths should shun violence. We should stop destroying national assets. Violence introduces tension and people can no longer feel secured. We also want to tell our young people that the President is working hard to implement all the demands of the youths…Future of the nation belongs to the young and we will make sure they are properly integrated into the developmental strides of the country.” Father of the victim, Rev. Dr. Godwin Omoha, who said a live bullet was extracted from his daughter’s head expressed optimism that his daughter would fully recover from the gunshot injury.
