It’s very overwhelm- ing and I’m happy to see that the fans are here with us and they’re supporting us, so it’s a good feeling,” he told Su- per Eagles media. “I bring energy, I want to play fast and just make it hard for my opponent and win the game of course. “Hopefully, by God’s grace, that’s the aim, I want to score goals every single game I play, but I want to just do all I can for the team to get the result that we can get.” The 24-year-old will be expected to play a significant role when the Super Eagles take on the Leone Stars in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game today.
