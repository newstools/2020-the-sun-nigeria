By Ahmed Abubakar, Dutse Jigawa State Governor Muhammed Badaru Abubakar has assured of the resolve of the Federal Government to set up an industrial hub adjacent to the newly commissioned Gagarawa Power station. Governor Muhammed Badaru, who stated this Saturday during the commissioning ceremony of a new 2 x 60 MVA, 132/33KV transmission substation at Gagarawa Local Government Area, declared that the station would be utilised for the provision of electricity to a proposed future industrial hub.
