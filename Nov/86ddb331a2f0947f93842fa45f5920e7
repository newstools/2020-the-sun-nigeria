The Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA), in its commitment to ensure that residents at the grassroots have access to affordable, effective and quality healthcare, has partnered with First Bank of Nigeria Limited to utilise its over 13,000 Firstmonie Agents as payment channels for the Lagos State Health  Scheme (LSHS). LASHMA General Manager,  Dr. Emmanuella Zamba, made the disclosure during  the flag-off of the partnership in Alausa, saying that the partnership became necessary to facilitate ease of health insurance premium transactions for residents, especially at the grassroots. She noted that FirstBank was selected for the partnership in recognition of its effectiveness, efficiency and large clientele base. “The Agency realised that not all residents can go to the bank or use online platforms for the payment of their health insurance premiums, hence the agency identified the need for other payment platforms such as the Firstmonie Agents,”, Zamba explained. Asserting that the partnership would avail residents the opportunity to  pay either N40,000 annually for family plan or N8,500 annually for individual plan through any of the Firstmonie agents, the General Manager said that once the insurance premium is paid before 25th of every month, such enrollee can receive care from the first day of the following month at any public or private hospital of  their choice within the scheme’s network providers.
