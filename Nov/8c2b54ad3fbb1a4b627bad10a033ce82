Christopher Oji The Lagos State Police Command has warned mischief makers against making false allegations against its Personnel. The warning came on the heels of alleged false allegations made against the officer incharge of State Traffic Office, CSP Oriyomi Titilayo Ilesanmi. The command has warned that in as much as the police respect people’s opinion and dignity as a responsible institution,”we will not accept or approbate any cheap  blackmail, false allegation and unwarranted outburst to rubbish and malign the police institution” . In a statement by Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, he noted that: “The attention of the Lagos State Police command has been drawn to a false, baseless and mischievous story on the Facebook and other social media links, by one Oluomo of Shasha, who wrongly alleged that the Officer in charge of the State Motor Traffic Division, CSP Titilayo Oriyomi and traffic officers on duty at Simbiat junction by Computer Village, Ikeja  Lagos on Friday December 13,  2019, assaulted and seized some of his items unlawfully. “The command was taken aback by this unfounded allegation from someone who ought to have been charged to court for conduct likely to cause breach of peace, harassing, obstructing and threatening to kill the police operatives within three (3) days of the incident with his diabolical powers.”
