Floyd Mayweather has insisted that he will never fight against a professional boxer again, though the undefeated star admitted he is open to exhibition bouts with UFC stars. ‘Money’ retired from boxing in 2017 after taking his unblemished record to 50-0 with a win over UFC star Conor McGregor in a huge crossover bout that saw the 43-year-old rake in around $275million. Mayweather is regularly linked with a return to the ring, but the former five-weight world champion has stressed that he will never return to face a professional boxer. ‘As of right now, I’m doing exhibitions,’ Mayweather told CNN. ‘I’m 100% sure that I’m not fighting against any boxer anymore. ‘So, that’s out of the question. I mean, just my faculties mean a lot to me. Money don’t make me, I make money and my health is more important than money. ‘As far as me doing exhibitions and me fighting MMA guys, will I do that in a box ring? Absolutely.’ Mayweather has a close relationship with UFC president Dana White, and was pictured with the supremo at a basketball game earlier this year.
