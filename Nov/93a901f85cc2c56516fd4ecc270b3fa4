Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja Following the recent havoc wreaked by flood in the country, the European Union (EU), has supported flood victims with €80,000 (N35.5 million). The EU Delegation to Nigeria and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), announced the donation in a statement by its Politics, Press and Information Officer, Mr Modestus Chukwulaka. The EU said the amount was meant for the vulnerable people affected by the floods in the states of Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara. “In response to the flash floods that have hit parts of Nigeria, the European Union is providing €80,000 (N35.5 million) in emergency humanitarian funding to assist the most vulnerable people in the worst affected states,” the EU said. The EU further said the funding will aid the Nigerian Red Cross Society in delivering the much-needed relief, including cash grants to enable households to acquire goods for their basic needs, to ensure access to safe drinking water, to provide sanitation services to affected communities, and to promote best hygiene practices despite the emergency context. “The assistance receiving EU support will be focused on helping vulnerable people affected by the floods in the states of Jigawa, Kebbi, Kwara, Sokoto and Zamfara. “The funding is part of the EU’s overall contribution to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). “Over 150 people have died, and around 25,000 are displaced as a result of the heavy rainfall in Nigeria that began in September. “Some of the worst flooding occurred in early October, caused by the bursting banks of the Benue and Niger rivers. Affected communities have lost their homes, essential belongings, and cropland. Floodwaters are also exposing communities to the risk of waterborne diseases,” the EU also said.
