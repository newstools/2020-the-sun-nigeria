Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Three months after the Lagos and Abuja international airports were opened to international flights, the Federal Government is set to reopen Kano and Port Harcourt international airports. Speaking during a briefing of the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19, yesterday, Director-General, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Capt. Musa Nuhu, said the two airports would be reopened when the twin issues of ICT infrastructures and adequate number of staff to man the airports have been provided. He said the reopening of the two airports would  decongest Lagos and Abuja airports and make travel more convenient for passengers.

He,however, did not disclose the date for the  reopening of the two airports.  Government had on   September 5 announced  resumption of international flights from Abuja and Lagos airports.
