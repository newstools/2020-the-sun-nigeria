Judex Okoro, Calabar The Calabar Zone of the Academic Staff Union of Universities has said IPPIS is a cesspool of corruption and does not have integrity as payment platform for university lecturers. The Zonal Coordinator of the zone, Dr. Aniekan Brown, who stated this in Calabar during a zonal press briefing, said the payment platform only attends to issues of payroll and has no control personnel information and this makes it subceptible. Brown said: “Our Union has been rejecting this IPPIS since 2013 and government challenged us to provide an alternative which the union did named UTAS, University Transparency Accountability Solution. “Because of how IPPIS is operated and because it does not match the peculiarities of Nigerian universities and because the backend and and front end do not really interface. Therefore, IPPIS is a cesspool of corruption. “It is only attending to issues of payroll and has no control over personnel information, that alone is enough to reduce that platform and make it subceptible”, he said. He said the strike will continue until government demonstrates credible commitment to tertiary education in the country. He listed the key points of their demand from government to include adoption of the UTAS payment platform, setting up of Visitation panels to universities, release of accrued revitalisation funds for tertiary institutions among others.
