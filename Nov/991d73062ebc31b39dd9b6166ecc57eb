Okwe Obi, Abuja A coalition of 50 civil society organisations have dismissed report linking the military taskforce codenamed Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), to the alleged killing of four persons during a raid on the house of the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, at Lamingo area of Plateau State. The groups said the report, which was attributed to some persons in Gwafan Community, was misleading and could incite residents against the military which would truncate the fight against bandits and insurgents. This was contained in a statement by heads of Initiative For Justice and Equity Africa (INJUEA), Center for Humanitarian Advocacy (CEHUA), Forum of Plateau Mothers (FOPLMO), and Conscience Youths Network (COYON); Andrew Azi, Yakubu Bot, Rebecca Pam, and Isaiah Agwon respectively. They said: “Ordinarily, we would not have joined issues with allegation by the community neither should we have done same with the reporter that displayed her high-level incompetence and professional deficiency because we are not spokespersons to  the Nigeria Military or Operation Safe Haven.”
