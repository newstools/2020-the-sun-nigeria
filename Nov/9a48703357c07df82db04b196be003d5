The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr Bismarck Rewane, told our correspondent in a telephone interview that the CBN would do the needful to stop the naira from depreciating further. He said, “There are things that can be done. I know the central bank would do the needful because as long as forex is being rationed, there will be demand in other markets. They are doing their best; I am sure that they will do all that is necessary to ensure the currency stays stable.” The foremost economist noted that the dollar had fallen against other currencies.
