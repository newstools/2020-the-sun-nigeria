Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has described “as a bold move driven purely by principle rather than opportunistic motives.”, the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari while commending  the move said: “I am proud of Governor David Umahi for taking this bold decision in accordance with his conscience and principles rather than any external influence or coercion.” The President added, “Good governance is very important to us in the APC, and I’m glad that the governor has cited this as a major factor in his decision to join us. I urge our citizens to pay less emphasis on identity politics if we want our democracy to make a positive impact on our country.” He noted that “with men like Umahi, I foresee a brighter future for our democracy because the voters will be more motivated by performance records of parties and their candidates. “Let me once again; commend the boldness of Governor Umahi for taking this courageous decision in a country where principles are in short supply among many. I know people might call him names, but that is the price men of principles have to pay for acting according to their conscience and convictions.”
