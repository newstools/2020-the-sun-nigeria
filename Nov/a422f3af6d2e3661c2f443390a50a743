The governor said the state government would give victims of the mall financial supports, which would be in form of grants or loand to cushion the effect of the looting and destruction of their shops and stores. Governor Sanwo-Olu explained that the grant would be in form of government giving financial support to the victims, which they were not expected to pay back while lending support would be in form of loans, adding that he was already discussing with some financial institutions to assist with zero interest loan.
