The Bible Society of Nigeria (BSN) has inaugurated two new areas in Osun and Oyo states. In a statement, the Spokesperson for the society, Benjamin Mordi, said the approval to create the new areas was granted at the National Board Meeting of the society which took place virtually in August. According to him, the new areas include Ijesa in Osun State and Oyo Area 2 in Oyo State. He said Ijesa was carved out of the present Osun Area 1, while Oyo Area 2 was carved out of the present Oyo Area. “With  the new areas, BSN now has 31 full-fledged areas and six associate areas making a total of 37 areas across the country,” Mordi said.
