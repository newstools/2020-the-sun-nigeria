Nigeria’s leading provider of e-learning platforms, EduTech, in collaboration with  Obafemi Awolowo University Centre for Distance Learning (OAU CDL) has announced the successful graduation of 200 nursing students with two bagging first-class degrees. Speaking about the prospects and challenges of online learning during a recent webinar organised by EduTech, a technology learning platform, its general manger, Mr. Femi Shonubi, said EduTech was able to reduce the cost of bandwidth to support students’ online connectivity and that the online programme was able to eliminate challenges of hostel accommodation for campus students and the challenges of transportation for off-campus students, since they could have virtual online studies with their lecturers from the comfort of their homes. He said, “We are delighted to help facilitate another batch of graduates in partnership with the OAU CDL. Coming at a time that there’s renewed focus on alternate means of studying following the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased to prove that e-learning platforms are not only viable in Africa but hardworking students can leverage our platforms to bag first-class degrees as demonstrated by the duo of Olumuyiwa Elizabeth Amoo and Dolapo Rukayat Adebisi who finished top of the class following four-rigorous years of studying including practical and written examinations.”
