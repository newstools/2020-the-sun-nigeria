Rita Okoye, Lagos Expressing his indignation at the inhuman act of rape, Nigerian-American rapper Joel LivingGod, better known as King Joel, has stated that it is a despicable act that wounds the soul. ‘I condemn rape and plead to the conscience of the perpetrators that they may have pity on the helpless victim who may never forgo the trauma. I also urge our government to make the punishment for rape more rigid so as to discourage such evil,’ he said while addressing some activists in an event in Enugu recently. Speaking further, King Joel reiterated on the need for victims to summon the courage to speak out so that the perpetrators don’t go unpunished for such an evil act.
