A political group affiliated to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in UK, Mandate  International, UK has hailed the actions of the peaceful protesters considering the way the banned SARS was brutalising Nigerians mostly youths Mandate International UK under the coordination of the APC stalwart, Hon. Ibrahim Yusuf said the protest was all Nigerians needed at the time but condemned the unnecessary arson and looting that preceded the protest. Yusuf in a statement condemned the way some hoodlums and thugs turned the peaceful protest into an avenue to wreak havoc on peace of the nation. He condemns the insinuations that thugs were destroying properties owned by the government and individuals thinking that Tinubu owned them all. He said it was condemnable to think that some hoodlums, either sponsored or otherwise, would take such an action against a man who has built bridges and made people across the land and has never relented in doing so. “Asiwaju has done all within his power to ensure he delivers the best at all times. “At Mandate International UK, we urge those who are planning to bring the political strongman down to have a rethink, Tinubu will not succumb, he remains the rally point for Lagos and Nigeria politics at large.” Yusuf encouraged the social media influencers to be wary of their actions as their responses to the Lagos protest have brought wanton damages to the state and the nation at large. He described the burning of public institutions including Nigeria Port Authority (NPA) and others as surprising and condemnable. The statement urged the governors elected on the platform of the APC to make governance people’s more friendly so as give clarity to the difference between progressives and others. It also commiserates with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos state and other affected governors of the federation.
