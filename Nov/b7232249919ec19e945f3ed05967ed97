Emma Njoku GO Round Football Club has thrown its gates open to interested players who wish to undertake the club’s screening exercise ahead of the forthcoming  league season. The club, in a statement signed by its Secretary, China Acheru, said the screening will commence on Wednesday, November 4 and close on Friday, November 13, at the Kris Dera Hotel Stadium in Omoku, Rivers State. “Interested players, with outstanding qualities, should take advantage of the screening window to prove that they are good enough to don the colours of the club next season,” Acheru said in the statement, yesterday. He said that the screening sessions will hold between 8am and 10am daily, except on Sundays, stressing that the gates have been thrown open to “only those who believe they can compete at the professional cadre.” Meanwhile, old players of the club are expected to resume training on Sunday, November 15, ahead of the 2020/2021 Nigeria National League (NNL) season which is expected to kick off soon.
