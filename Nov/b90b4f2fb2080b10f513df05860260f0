As technology transforms industries and economies around the world, shattering barriers and establishing new frontiers of possibilities, Nigeria must prioritize investment in her most important resource, her people, in order to compete favourably in the comity of nations and create opportunities for her teeming population. ‘Deremi Atanda, executive director at SystemSpecs, Africa’s leading provider of innovative financial and human capital technology solutions and services, made this disclosure recently at the second edition of the Nigeria Digital Economy Summit (NDES) which held virtually. At the session which focussed on the need to develop talents locally to grow a digital economy, Atanda said: “The quality of the workforce of any organisation is a major determinant of the value such an institution is able to provide. As such, it is non-negotiable for all stakeholders to commit to capacity development in order to fully harness our people’s potential.” “Talent will follow economic development,” he added, noting that recent wave of manpower exit from Nigeria is not new and that SystemSpecs has had a share of it at the turn of this century when the firm lost a lot of its technology talent to the West. He added that with innovation never stopping, it is important to also regularly re-equip our talent base, not only to remain relevant in the present but to play pivotal roles in determining the advancements of the future. As government and other stakeholders invest in human capacity development, it is crucial that organisations maximise their workforce, ensure corporate objectives are met and maintain satisfied staff members, whether they work remotely, practise flexible work hours or work fully from a physical location. HumanManager, one of the most successful human resource management solutions in Africa and a product of SystemSpecs, can help organisations meet these goals, even with the “new normal.” The Nigeria Digital Economy Summit (NDES) is a privately funded, public-private partnership forum that supports Nigeria’s digital transformation into a leading digital economy.
