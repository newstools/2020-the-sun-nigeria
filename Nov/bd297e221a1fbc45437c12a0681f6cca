Daniel Kanu The leading  rights coalition of civil society in the Niger Delta region, United Niger Delta Energy Development Security Service (UNDEDSS) has announced an immediate embargo on further discussions with the Federal- government on issues and plights of the Niger Delta People. Rising from an emergency webinar on Thursday, the group said all future cooperation with the federal government has ceased. “We are tired of this deceit from the federal government. we have found out that they do not seem to be sincere in their agreements with the region, so there is no need to continue to waste our time” the group noted. In a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Comrade Tony Uranta, issued after  the meeting, UNDEDSS said the decision would remain until the 2016 16 point demand laid directly before President Mohammadu Buhari is urgently and comprehensively met as promised by  the president at a parley held in Aso Villa with representatives of the group and Niger Delta Leaders. “Niger Delta will mark any putative regional leaders who will attempt to break the no more dialogue embargo.”Enough is enough. We shall no longer remain in a union where we are third-class citizens” the group noted in its terse statement.
