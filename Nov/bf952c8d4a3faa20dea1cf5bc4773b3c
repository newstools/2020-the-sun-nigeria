Paul Osuyi, Asaba Youths in Delta State have challenged the state government to work out positive reform that will enhance criminal justice system in the state public service. Among other things, they want the state government to immediately order the release of all detained persons arrested during curfew hours and were allegedly charged for arson and murder. Speaking on behalf of the #EndSARS Movement at a town hall meeting in Asaba, Mr. Harrison Gwamnishu, urged the state government to expedite action on creation of a five-member Police Complaints Committee to address complaints against the errant tactical squad of the police. This is even as he urged the authorities to put modalities in place to expeditiously address allegations of extortion, brutality and human rights abuses against errant members of security agencies. Governor Ifeanyi Okowa who deplored the attitude of some youths for their flagrant disobedience of the curfew hours, promised to liaise with the police authority on the fresh demands.
