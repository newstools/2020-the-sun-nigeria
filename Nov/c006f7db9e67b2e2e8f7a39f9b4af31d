Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State has said that his government will disburse N2 billion to agro-farmers in the state, to support their agricultural activities. He said that the fund, which would be disbursed in two weeks time, was received from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The Governor who announced this after his tour to communities submerged by floodwaters in Ogbaru, Anambra East and Anambra West LGAs of the state. According to him, “From the fund, 60 per cent will go to women while 40 per cent will go to men. This will be launched at Ekwueme Square, Awka. “The agency in charge has profiled who should get what and when they will round up the process; we should be able to launch it immediately for distribution,” Obiano said. The governor who was accompanied by the Executive Secretary, Anambra State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Chief Paul Odenigbo and other top naval and police officers. The Governor observed that even though the floodwater was receding, it had destroyed many properties in affected communities. “Houses are still submerged and farmlands along with planted crops washed away. “The situation has displaced a lot of families. It has destroyed their farm produce. There is a need to rehabilitate them because they are trying to survive from the shock of COVID-19 pandemic before the emergence of flooding. “They require major support both in cash and material items needed for their rehabilitation.’’ He pleaded with the Federal Government to intervene in the situation in order to restore their fading hopes. The SEMA boss, Odenigbo in a remark maintained that the federal government had since sent in a team from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to do a proper assessment of affected flood victims in the state. He, however, noted that the assessment would include people and families affected, farmlands and buildings.
