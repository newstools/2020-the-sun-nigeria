It also said that the lawmaker, who would produce a three-year tax clearance certificate, must not be standing criminal trial in any court. The court ruled that the lawmaker, who would undertake to always attend Faisal’s trial at each adjourned date, held that “where the surety fails without cogent reason, the court is at liberty to revoke the bail.” Dan-Galadima had deposed to an affidavit of means, on Dec. 11, 2019, to always come to court at every adjourned date and produce Faisal in court. Faisal was arraigned, on Oct. 25, by the EFCC on a three-count charge bordering on money laundering. However, he pleaded not guilty to all the charges. At the resumed hearing on Wednesday, EFCC’s Lawyer, Mohammed Abubakar, said though Faisal was on bail, he was not in court.
