(Reuters/NAN) Inter Milan’s chief executive Giuseppe Marotta said on Saturday he had sensed growing discontent among clubs over having to release players for international matches during the COVID-19 pandemic. Marotta added that players should exercise “great caution” when responding to a call-up for their national teams. The next international break in November will see European teams playing three matches each. There will be two rounds of games in the South American 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying competition, with many players having to travel from Europe. Inter Milan’s squad includes regular internationals for Argentina, Chile, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia, Serbia and Morocco. “There is a general discontent that is spreading through all the club directors about players who have to respond to so many commitments,” Marotta said before his team’s Serie A match at home to Parma. “We have to limit the situation, at least with the national team matches.” Marotta said he did not want to stir up controversy nor boycott international matches. However, he added that Inter Milan should be “rigid” when dealing with international call-ups. “It’s only right that national federations work with us to protect the players and we will be clear that they must think long and hard when calling up our players,” the Inter Milan official said. “For a player to accept a call-up, he has to be in the right mental and physical condition. “If he is tired, or has muscular problems, he must stay at home. I ask for more respect for the clubs.”
