Plateau EndSARS protesters said the group is demanding justice for all victims of police and military brutality through the Independent Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by Governor Simon Lalong. The protesters planned to meet on the streets if there is no significant progress in meeting their demands after 90 days. A messenger of the group, Plangkat Milaham who made the submission during an interactive session with Plateau youths at Government House Jos, said: “We demand justice for all victims of police and military brutality (Henry Anthony Dokotri, Joshua Malan, Rinji Peter Bala, Shedrach Kums Fenan, and all others) through the Independent Judicial Panel of Inquiry which has been set up to oversee the investigation, report and prosecution of police misconduct. “We demand that the public hearings be streamed live and broadcasted across all media; We demand that the representatives of Civil Society groups and youth members of the panel should be nominated by the protesters. “We demand the appropriate compensation for all victims and their families through the immediate setting up of a Victims Support Fund and that disbursement is proper, transparent and public. We demand an upward review in Police salaries, improvement of working and living conditions and other welfare packages so that they are adequately compensated for the important responsibility of protecting lives and properties of citizens.”
