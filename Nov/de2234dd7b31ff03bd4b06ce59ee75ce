Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee will on Tuesday meet to deliberate on several pressing issues, barring any last-minute change in plans. The Caretaker committee, which held its last physically meeting shortly after the Ondo State governorship election to celebrate the party’s victory, could not meet again due to the activities of the #EndSARS protests. Although the items that would constitute the agenda of the meeting are still sketchy as at the time of filing the report, there are strong indications that the future of the committee will top the list of what to be deliberated. There have also been repeated threats from several party stakeholders for the extension of the tenure of the caretaker committee, including the ultimatum from a group, the APC Concerned Members. Pressed to confirm what might constitute the agenda of the meeting, the APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, promised to update our Daily Sun once he confirms. However, sources close to the party secretariat told our correspondent that arrangements have already been concluded to hold a very crucial meeting on Tuesday. “There is an urgent need for the Caretaker Committee to meet. There have been many unresolved issues especially the future of the committee. They will likely deliberate on the controversial extension of its tenure which expires next month. “Don’t also forget that there have been several ultimata from a certain group that identified itself as Concerned Members. They will also evaluate the extent of the progress the various reconciliation committees set up and the possibilities of meeting up with the December deadline for the organization of the National convention,” the source noted. Another source equally told our correspondent that the committee will equally resolve on the pending membership registration, revealing that contract for it has already been awarded.
