Clinker exports have steadily been ramping up in Q3 after our maiden shipment in June 2020, whilst land exports have also resumed,” he said. “In the period under consideration, Dangote Cement has exported 7 clinker vessels from Nigeria via the Apapa export terminal, while plans are on track to commission the Port Harcourt export terminal before the end of the year,” he added.
