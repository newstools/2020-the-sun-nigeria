Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki. Some aggrieved members of the National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives (NANNM)Â  Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (AE-FUTHA) Ebonyi state have renounced their membership of the association following crisis that have rocked the chapter of the association. The Coordinator of the aggrieved members, Mr.Okafor Christian, disclosed this on behalf of his colleagues at a press conference in Abakaliki. Okafor said his members have communicated their complaints and requests to the national leadership of the body, adding that they were open for dialogue, negotiations and resolutions. He alleged that they gathered that the national leadership of the association had no interest in addressing their concerns, lamenting that they were given the option of accepting the statusquo or exiting the association. Mr.Okafor accused the union of adopting some unproductive and destructive approaches to issues like the method of sharing their check-off dues generated from the unit, referring to the sharing formula as national 50 percent ,state 30 percent and unit 20 percent. The aggrieved members therefore called on the national leadership of the association to reduce the check-off dues to a flat rate deduction of N1000. They also demanded for a refund of those that were deducted without their consents with an apology letter issued to them. The aggrieved members insisted that they were not being properly taken care of by the association, and called on the national leadership to design welfare packages for members on retirement ,chronic illnesses and death while in active services, stressing that it is the core essence of unionism.
