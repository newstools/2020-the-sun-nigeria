The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that tertiary institutions across the country had been closed since March 27, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.
The registrar urged the returning students to comply with all the COVID-19 protocols, as stated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
