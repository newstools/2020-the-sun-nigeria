We have very poor reading culture but I enjoin all present to develop the habit of reading as that would help shapen their understanding.” On her part, wife of the author of the books, Rev. (Mrs.) Patience Udenyi disclosed that her husband has always had passion for writing saying the unveiling of the six new books was an addition to eight other books he had written before. Responding, author of the books, Bishop Udenyi thanked God for enabling him to fulfil his vision of writing books for the advancement of the Kingdom and assured that the books would bless as many who would read them.
