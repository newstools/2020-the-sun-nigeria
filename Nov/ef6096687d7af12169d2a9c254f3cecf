Gyang Bere, Jos The Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSEF), Plateau State, has said that the unity of Nigeria is non-negotiable and therefore cannot be tampered with. In a press statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Friday Darwam, in Jos, yesterday, the Forum expressed displeasure over the looting and vandalization of public infrastructure by hoodlums, who hijacked the #EndSARS protests. It called on the Federal Government to address issues that threaten the collective interest of the country. Noting that the vandalisation of public infrastructure by hoodlums had taken the country backward, NOSEF challenged youths to guard against acts capable of mortgaging their future.
