It was learnt that representatives of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) left the venue of the meeting in protest barely five minutes after it started. TUC President,  Quadri Olaleye, accused the Federal Government of dishonesty, playing to the gallery and painting organised labour in a bad light before civil servants and the public. Representing the NLC was its deputy president, Najeem Yasin, while Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Petroleum, Timiprye Sylva, Minister of state for power, Goddy Agba and Secretary to the Government, Boss Mustapha, represented the Federal Government at the meeting.
