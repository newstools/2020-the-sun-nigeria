Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja A non governmental organization, Civil Society Groups For Good Governance (CSGGG) has advised journalists to always verify their information and not rely on “side talks” before going to press. The Group, apparently making reference to some media reports against the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, believe that such extra effort will discourage biased reportage that could be detrimental to national development. CSGGG President, Ogakwu Dominic, in a statement released in Abuja, on Thursday, noted the critical role of the media as watchdog of the society, but insisted that the information should not be published until adequate research is made and its coherence and completeness are achieved . Dominic decried the constant mis-report against Fashola as the a Minister of Works particularly the recent report in some media that he facilitated the movement of N4.6 billion to private pockets. He explained that the payments were duly approved and it followed due procedures and protocols that had to be observed as regards payment. He, further reiterated that “Truth” is the holy chalice of journalism, therefore, pleading that PremiumTimesNG, Sahara Reporters and other mediums, that have published the story so far, should pulled it down, seek clarifications and then go back to do detailed report for publication.
