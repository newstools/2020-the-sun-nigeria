Commenting on the performance of the market, stock market analysts who spoke to Daily Sun, said the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to leave all key indicators unchanged, kept stock market investors relieved amid the bias that Nigerian banks would have enough headway in mitigating the prevailing economic uncertainties currently in play. They however, called on investors to be cautious as transactions resume today, taking into consideration the low presence of the foreign portfolio investors amid low investments seen lately in the market while adding that stringent capital controls set in place by the CBN could limit the bullish run in the long term. Analysts at Cordros Capital, in an emailed note to Daily Sun, said, they expected alpha-seeking investors to continue rotating their portfolio towards equities amid attractive dividend yields on bellwether stocks. “We expect market performance to be dominated by the bulls, as positioning by early birds in dividend-paying stocks ahead of FY 2020 dividend declarations should outweigh profit-taking activities. We reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings”, they said. For his part, a stockbroker who craved anonymity, said the macroeconomic situation still remains uncertain while adding that profit taking would ensue in this week’s transactions.
