Meanwhile, former Everton defender, Michael Ball is full of praise for Iwobi after the Nigerian delivered an excellent performance during the Toffees 3-2 win against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon. Writing in his column in the Liverpool Echo, Ball stated: “Alex Iwobi, in particular, deserves credit. “In the first half, he was our out-ball, and you could see just watching from the TV screen he was maybe a little scared to go too far forward, and he had his defensive mind on a little bit. “But he became our outlet, and he didn’t have his back to play, which seemed to help him and suited his game.
