The Executive Board of the International Press Institute (IPI), the global network of editors, media executives and communication experts devoted to a free press, has approved the nomination of IPI veteran, Raheem  Adedoyin to the Board. Adedoyin, seasoned journalist and  longest serving Secretary of the IPI Nigerian chapter, was nominated unanimously  early this month  by the Nigerian chapter to replace former chairman of the News Agency of Nigeria,  Mallam Wada Maida,  who died last August. The Board’s approval was conveyed to  Adedoyin at the weekend by IPI Executive Director, Barbara Triofri. “Congratulations, Raheem! I am very glad that you are a member of the IPI Executive Board and look forward to working with you!” Barbara said in an email conveying the approval. A leading member of the Nigeria Institute of Public Relations (NIPR), Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) and the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Adedoyin has devoted his energy to  growing the  IPI in Nigeria. Adedoyin, who headed the institute’s secretariat for the hugely successful 2018 IPI World Congress and General Assembly in Abuja is a regular delegate at the World Congresses and other IPI events. He was at the inaugural meeting of IPI National Committees  in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2011, and has been involved in IPI Advocacy activities, including an IPI Mission to Zambia  in 2010.
