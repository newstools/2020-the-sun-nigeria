Benjamin Babine, Abuja The Federal Government has approved the rescheduling of the Public Works programme which was supposed to commence on October 1. According to the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr Festus Keyamo, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the program be rescheduled to November 1. The programme is meant to engage 1,000 persons from all the 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the country for menial jobs for three months. Keyamo stated that the approval was based on his memo to the President informing him that most of the proposed project sites were still water-logged because the rains had not abated. He further noted that the programme was designed for execution during the dry season when most of the project sites would be ready for work. He said the capturing of those to be engaged by the selected banks has been progressing seamlessly across the 774 Local Government Areas. The Minister pointed out that information regarding the banks attached to the specific Local Government Areas could be found in the projectâ€™s website:www.specificpublicworks.gov.ng
