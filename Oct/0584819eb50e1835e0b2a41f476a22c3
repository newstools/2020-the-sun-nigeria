The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described Governor Sanwo-Olu’s 24-hour curfew over unabated #EndSARS protests, as confrontational and ill-advised. The PDP in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Taofik Gani, said Sanwo-Olu’s decision could aggravate the agitations by the protesters.
