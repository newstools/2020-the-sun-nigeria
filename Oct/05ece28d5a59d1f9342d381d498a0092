Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti The lingering crisis between Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), has taken another dimension, as the Union accused the outgoing Vice Chancellor, Prof. Kayode Soremekun, of clandestine plans to impose his Deputy Vice Chancellor, Prof. Abayomi Fasina, as his successor.  The Union said Prof. Soremekun had allegedly been running the university like a private entity and promoting culture of ethnicity, nepotism, financial recklessness and abridgement of due process for personal aggrandizement. ASUU said Prof. Fasina who allegedly absconded from the Ekiti State University (EKSU) in 2015 and collected double salaries running into a sum of N3.4 million from the two institutions for six months lacks the requisite integrity and moral qualities to be appointed a vice chancellor. Reacting to ASUU allegations, Soremekun via the Deputy Director, Corporate Services, Adeyinka Ademuyiwa, said Prof. Fasina was not being imposed by anybody.  He added that the process of getting a new VC has begun and noted that he is hopeful of the emergence of a new VC from this ‘transparent’ process, saying the zonal ASUU, which commanded poor followership among lecturers in FUOYE lacks the credibility to impose anyone on the institution through incessant attacks and obnoxious practices.        His tenure as VC of FUOYE will end in February, 2021. But the Coordinator of ASUU, Akure Zone, Prof. Olu Olu Olufayo, who spoke at a press conference held at Ekiti State University, Ado-Ekiti (EKSU), explained that the lingering crisis between the union and FUOYE’ s management was not a personal vendetta against anybody but to prevent the university system from being undermined and desecrated.
