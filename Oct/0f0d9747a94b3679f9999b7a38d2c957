Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday declared that his administration would not allow hooligans to overrun the country. This is even as he said it was unfortunate that the initial genuine and well-intended protest by youths in parts of the country against the Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was hijacked and misdirected. He said this while briefing former Heads of State and Presidents of Nigeria, at a virtual meeting, he presided from the Council Chambers in Abuja. The meeting was attended by Gen. Yakubu Gowon, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Chief Ernest Shonekan, Gen. Abulsalami Abubakar, and former President Goodluck Jonathan. According to Buhari, the government will not fold its arms and allow miscreants and criminals continue to perpetrate acts of hooliganism in the country. A statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said Buhari recounted the initial concessions made by his administration on the demands of youths protesting against the excesses of some members of SARS. He recalled that the youths had demanded that the squad be disbanded, and further articulated the additional demands, including: “The immediate release of all arrested protesters; Justice for deceased victims of police brutality and appropriate compensation for their families; Setting up an independent body to oversee the investigation and prosecution of all reports of Police misconduct within 10 days; Psychological evaluation and re-training of all disbanded SARS officers before they can be re-deployed; and increase in Police salary.” The President declared: “We accepted all the demands and proceeded immediately to scrap SARS and started the process of addressing the other demands. Unfortunately, the protesters refused to call off the protest and engage the Government to address their grievances. Instead, they became emboldened and gradually turned violent.” President Buhari expressed concern that in the mayhem that ensued, many lives have been lost, a number of public and private properties completely destroyed or vandalized. Reiterating his pledge to Nigerians from the nationwide broadcast on Thursday, the President reaffirmed: “We will continue to improve good governance through our democratic process including through sustained engagement. “We shall also continue to ensure that liberty and freedom, as well as the fundamental rights of all citizens are protected. Here, I want to also reaffirm our commitment to preserving the unity of this country.” The President thanked the former Heads of State for attending the meeting and their invaluable comments, observations and advice, adding that “Nigerians expect nothing less from responsible statesmen.” Each of the former leaders commended President Buhari for steps taken so far to restore calm and order to the country and also applauded the presidential broadcast of Thursday as detailed and soothing to the country. “I commend the speech of last night. The nation had been waiting. You made points that I believe need to be commended. Peaceful demonstration is part of democratic practice. The demands of the genuine protesters were accepted, and you are working on implementation. We commend you,” former President Obasanjo was quoted as saying. The former Heads of state were unanimous in their view that generation of employment and growing the economy including through direct foreign investments were critical to checking youth restiveness. They also expressed their condolences to the bereaved families of civilians, policemen and soldiers killed as a result of the violent protest, and reaffirmed the commitment to respect the fundamental rights of citizens, including for peaceful protest as enshrined in the Constitution. The former Heads of State also condemned the divisive and inciting pronouncements of separatists, and were of the opinion that such acts should be stopped. Equally, the former leaders commended the actions taken by Governors to address the demands of the EndSARS protesters and their efforts to check the excesses of those who perpetrated violent acts and conduct. They called on youths to pursue peaceful means, in seeking redress through engagement with Government and encouraged further conversation with the youths and other stakeholders in the country.
