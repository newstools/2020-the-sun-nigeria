The President, Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ), Mrs Ifeyinwa Omowole, has called on female journalists in the country to prioritise their safety as they carry out their duties. Omowole made the call on Friday in Abuja, following the recent violence in some parts of the country over the #EndSARS protest. She advised journalists to be vigilant and prioritise their safety while discharging their duties. The NAWOJ president also appealed to Nigerians to unite and pray for Godâ€™s mercy and intervention to avert further bloodshed that would affect the peace and development of the nation. According to her, youths in Nigeria had sacrificed their comfort to protest peacefully on the streets, while demanding for a better life, as the older generation had failed them. She expressed sadness over the turn of events, especially the reported killings, arson and vandalism of properties. Omowole, therefore, appealed to the protesters to sheath their swords and remain calm as their demands had been made known to the world. (NAN)
