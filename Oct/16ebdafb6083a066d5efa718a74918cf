 Over 6,000 Nigerians have applied for the Amber Drinks Empowerment Programme which was launched to ensure that Nigerians are financially independent to cope with life while enhancing their living standard. According to the Head of Sales Amber Drinks Ltd, Temitope Adetiba, “Thousands of applications were received through the Amber Drinks Empowerment website and via sms. The online portal for recruitment of beneficiaries opened on August 24, 2020 and we had to shortlist and sensitize over a thousand beneficiaries in the Start-up loan’ and the ‘Business Support’ program. The empowerment programme featured training for beneficiaries every Tuesday through the month of September and will continue this October. On his own part, one of the Amber Drinks Empowerment Programme beneficiary, Matesun Babatunde, had this to say, The Start-up Loan offers the beneficiaries N100,000 on a 4 months repayment plan with the first 30 days interest-free and a below-market interest rate of 5 percent  flat. The Business Support Program is set to empower 200 applicants with direct employment and coaching on how to manage the recharge spots. This will cater to small-time beverage retailers. Shortlisted beneficiaries will open an account with the company and each person will be credited with one-hundred thousand naira only. This will then be debited automatically with 20 cartons of Amber Energy Drink which would be traded in for repayment by the beneficiaries. To be a part of this program, interested persons must apply online, log onto www.amberenergydrink.com/empowerment and follow through the prompts or simply text Amber, your full name and location to 34778 and they will receive an auto-response to follow-through. Successful applicants would be invited for a short training and onboarding session. Since its formal launch in Nigeria in June 2020, Amber Energy Drink’s purpose has been to make life easier for Nigerians with a focus on empowerment.
