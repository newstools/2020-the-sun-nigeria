PSC Head of Press and Public Relations, Ikechukwu Ani, who made this known said Commission was happy with the judgment of the court and would continue to work with the Nigeria Police Force for the collective good of the nation.

The Commission is happy with the judgment and will continue to work with the Nigeria Police Force for the collective good of the nation. “Meanwhile the Commission has continued to receive several calls on the fate of the 2019 and the on-going 2020 recruitment into the Constable cadre of the Nigeria Police Force already declared null and void by the judgment. “The Commission will soon meet to take a decision on the implications of the judgment and the way forward.
