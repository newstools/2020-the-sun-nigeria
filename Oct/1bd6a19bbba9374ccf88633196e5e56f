Third seed Aryna Sabalenka stormed to a 6-2 6-2 victory over compatriot Victoria Azarenka to win the inaugural J&T Banka Ostrava Open and the first all-Belarusian WTA final on Sunday. Former world number one Azarenka, who has been in top form since tennis restarted following its pandemic-enforced hiatus, needed a medical time-out in the second set. She ended up losing the match in 68 minutes. “I want to first of all congratulate Aryna and her team on a good week,” Azarenka said. “It was my pleasure to play against you in the final, unfortunately not in the best way. “Thank you everybody and please stay safe. I also want to just say ‘hi’ to my baby boy Leo.” Sabalenka had to twice battle back from the brink of defeat —- first against American Coco Gauff and then against Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo —-  to reach the final. But she showed no sign of the inconsistencies that have often dogged her on the big stage. She dominated from behind the baseline with her trademark powerful groundstrokes, running away with the match after breaking early in each set. The world number 12 wrapped up the one-sided affair with an unreturnable serve out wide. She celebrated her seventh WTA career singles title and second of the year with a fist pump and a kiss blown to the heavens. “This was not the best final,” Sabalenka told her opponent at the trophy presentation. “Hopefully you will get better soon. “Thank you everyone who made this week possible. I enjoyed myself every day here.” (Reuters/NAN)
