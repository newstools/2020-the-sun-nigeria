Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti The Governor of Ekiti State, John Kayode Fayemi, has approved the conversion and inter-cadre transfer of 603 officers in the State Civil Service. The conversion and inter-cadre transfer were granted for the officers who obtained approved study leave to undertake courses of study in higher institutions. The last time a major conversion and inter-cadre transfer were carried out by the State Civil Service Commission was in 2012 during Governor Fayemi’s first term in office. Governor Fayemi said the approval was in line with the administration’s commitment to excellent service delivery through highly motivated work force, adding that the civil service remains a strategic partner in the quest for an all-round development of the state through effective implementation of the administration’s five -pillar development agenda. He urged the beneficiaries not to relent on their oars in their quest for personal and professional development, assuring that his administration is committed to the transformation agenda of the state civil service. The Head of Service, Mrs. Peju Babafemi, who disclosed the new development in her office, in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday, said the Governor’s approval for the conversion/advancement was a reflection of his commitment to the welfare of workers and their capacity building. Mrs Babafemi commended the Governor for his positive disposition to the enhancement of the career of workers in the State and advised workers to continue to give their best in terms of effective service delivery. The Head of Service directed that the 387 officers in the senior category and 216 officers in the junior category would undergo due process in line with the extant rules before letters are issued to them by the Civil Service Commission and the Office of Establishments and Service Matters.
