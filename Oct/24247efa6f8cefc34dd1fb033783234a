Solomon Ayado, Lafia Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule said on Wednesday that he alone among all Muslim governors in Nigeria had attended a church thanksgiving service after winning the governorship election in 2019. Governor Sule said he went to church on account of having been educated at a private Roman Catholic school growing up. The Governor attended the Roman Catholic Mission (RCM) Primary School, Gudi Station, in 1968. Mr Sule stated this during the commissioning/dedication of Evangelical Reformed Church of Christ (ERCC) ultra modern headquarters secretariat, along Keffi Road Alushi, Akwanga LGA of the State. He called on faith-based organisations, both Christian and Muslim, to support his administration, saying the State under his leadership will continue to carry everyone along to enhance peace, unity and development. The Governor, who chaired the occasion, was represented by his Special Adviser on Youths and Sports, Kwanta Yakubu. Sule donated N5 million to enable the church furnish the edifice. The Governor, in his message, stated: ‘The Government of the State recognises the contributions of the ERCC to the development of education, health, women and youth empowerment as well as leadership development programmes for the youth through the boys brigade and girls brigade programmes.’ He added that ‘the State Government will continue to partner with all faith-based organisations as veritable tools in the shaping of society for responsible citizenship and national patriotism for the promotion of peaceful co-existence in Nasarawa State.’
