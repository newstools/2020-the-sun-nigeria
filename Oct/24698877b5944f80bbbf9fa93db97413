The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has constituted a committee to review the framework for the licensing of Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) and recommend sustainable funding options for effective implementation of the proposed national fibre project. The constitution of the committee was sequel to the requirements of the new Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP 2020-2025) and reports of relevant committees set up by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which includes the Inter-Ministerial Review Committee on Multiple Taxation on Telecommunications Operators over Right-of-Way and the Technical Sub-Committee on Right-of-Way for Deepening Broadband Penetration in Nigeria. These requirements and reports relate to the imperative of reviewing the InfraCo framework to cater for the delays in take-off, change in exchange rate, supply chain and other challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the committee set up by the Commission has met with all licensed InfraCos as well as the preferred bidder for the North Central zone. The committee is also looking at the challenges facing the InfraCo project, the need for accelerated deployment of fibre infrastructure, means of mitigating the exorbitant RoW charges, among others. The commission is also working actively with the Broadband Implementation Steering Committee as constituted by the Hon. Minister of Communications and Digital Economy based on the recommendations and requirements of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP 2020-2025). Head of the NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said: “The InfraCo project is dear to the government because of its ability to enhance robust and pervasive broadband infrastructure to drive service availability, accessibility and affordability. We are keen on ensuring the project delivers maximum benefits for the economy at large and that is why the ongoing review is very critical to the overall success of the project in line with the new realities of the time.”
