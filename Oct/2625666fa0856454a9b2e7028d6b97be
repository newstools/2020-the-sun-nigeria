Sell pressures dominated Wednesday’s trading session on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as market capitalisation fell by N113 billion due to unrest in the nation’s economy. This is even as 34 stocks depreciated in value as investors booked gains from MTNN, GUINNESS and ARDOVA.  As a result, the All-Share index declined by 0.75 per cent to 28,449.49 points while year-to-date (YTD) return weakened to 6.0 per cent.

Further analysis showed that activity level on the nation’s bourse improved as the volume and value of stocks traded rose by 9.8 and 44.3 per cent to 326.6 million units and N4.2 billion respectively, exchanged in 4,367 deals. The most traded stocks by volume were UBA (40.3 million units), Zenith Bank(39.6 million units) and GT Bank (38.3 million units) while GT Bank (N1.1 billion), Zenith Bank (N800.9 million) and Nestle (N479.9 million) led by value. Reacting to the development, market watchers say they expect the equities market to close the week negative due to weak buying interests.
