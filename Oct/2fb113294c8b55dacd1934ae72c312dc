… As Barca, Juve draw in UCL … Man Utd in ‘Group of Death’ …. Chelsea gets easy ride By Paul Erewuba Manchester United have been drawn into the Champions League Group of Death – after being joined by Paris Saint-Germain and RB Leipzig. Coming out of the pot of second seeds, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been drawn into easily the toughest group of all: Group H. As well as facing the likes of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, United must also take on German giants RB Leipzig if they are to progress to the knockout stages. Solskjaer’s side will also face Turkish champions Istanbul Basaksehir in the 2020-21 Group of Death. Meanwhile, Chelsea were given one of the easier groups, facing Sevilla in Group E. However, Frank Lampard’s side must endure a long trip to Russian side Krasnodar, while also facing Champions League debutants Rennes. Liverpool – the 2019 Champions League winners – take on Ajax in Group D. The Premier League champions will also face exciting Serie A side Atalanta and Midtjylland, in the Danish side’s first-ever Champions League campaign. Manchester City, still desperately chasing their first Champions League crown, sit in a reasonably simple-looking Group C. Pep Guardiola’s squad will need to battle past Porto, Olympiacos and Marseille to reach the knockout stages. Elsewhere, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will face each other in a tasty-looking Group G, with Juventus paired with Barcelona. The two giants of world football will also take on Dynamo Kiev and Ferencvaros. Real Madrid were paired with Inter Milan in the pick of the Group B games – joining Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Monchengladbach. Bayern Munich drew Atletico Madrid in a tough Group A, along with RB Salzburg and Lokomotiv Moscow. Meanwhile Borussia Dortmund will take on Lazio, Zenit and Club Brugge in Group F.
