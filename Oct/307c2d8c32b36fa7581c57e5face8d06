Godwin Tsa, Abuja The High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, has been approached to stop the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Frank Ibezim, from contesting the Imo North Senatorial by-election fixed for October 31. In an originating summons marked CI/2776/2020 and dated September, the plaintiff, Maryann Okoro, prayed the court to also restrain the Independent National Election Commission (INEC), from accepting the nomination of Ibezim as the candidate of the party for the election. He told the court that Ibezim did not posses the required educational qualification which he claimed to have had in his INEC Form CF001. The plaintiff, through his lawyer, Mr Peter Abang, urged the court to disqualify the APC candidate based on the alleged false information supplied to INEC.
