He said criminal elements are out to carry out unwholesome trade. “It was further revealed that Committee also noted the progress being made in the fight against robberies in illegal and unregistered, commercial motor vehicles known as “one chance” and is committed to the introduction of innovative measures that will ensure the safety of commuters. “It however advises commuters to continue to exercise  caution and remain vigilant while boarding commercial vehicles. “With the advent of the “Ember” months, the Committee reiterates its commitment to ensuring the safety of road users across the FCT in accordance with existing guidelines by relevant agencies.
