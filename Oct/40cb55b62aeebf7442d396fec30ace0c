Fulani socio-cultural organisation, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, has accused some politicians in the South of masterminding the protests. The herdsmen claimed it was a ploy to undermine and overthrow a democratically elected government of President Muhammadu Buhari, and also intimidate the North to give up its rights to rule beyond 2023. A statement jointly signed by its Alhaji Bello Bodejo and Alhasan Saleh, questioned why the youths would continue to protest and disrupt socio-economic activities after their demand for the disbandment of SARS has been granted by the Federal Government.
