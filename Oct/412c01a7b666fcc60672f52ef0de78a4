Nigerian youths have been protesting in large numbers over the last few days, against the activities of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigeria Police Force that has been widely accused of unlawful arrests, torture and killings.

Ndidi, who is on the sidelines with a groin injury, claimed some of the country’s football stars are afraid of travelling home because of the unprofessional conduct of the security operatives which could turn to harassment. “#EndSARS for the safety of Nigerians… We are scared to visit home because the people who are meant to protect us are killing us. Looking good with dreads is not a crime,” Ndidi said. Also, former Arsenal and Serie A club, Roma have Nigerians in calling for an end to the activities SARS. After watching a video of how SARS operatives harass the youths on social media, Wright did not hesitate to lend his voice to the public outcry.
