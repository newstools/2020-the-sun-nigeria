Napoli’s record acquisition Victor Osimhen was shown a red card for the first time in his four-year professional career as the Italian Serie A side returned to winning ways in the UEFA Europa League, beating Real Sociediad 1-0 at the  Estadio de Anoeta – San Sebastian on Thursday night, allnigeriasoccer.com reports. The Nigeria international joined the fray in the 61st minute and was penalised for a foul on Real Sociedad winger Ander Barrenetxea with nine minutes left on the clock. In the 86th minute, Osimhen had the ball in the net from a well-worked set piece but the goal was ruled out by English referee Craig Pawson. The Super Eagles star was given his marching orders to leave the pitch for a second yellow card in the second minute of stoppage time after a foul on Le Normand. Osimhen was expelled for the very first time in his 96th game as a professional comprising 16 for Wolfsburg, 36 in the colours of RSC Charleroi, 38 for Lille and six in a Napoli shirt. The 21-year-old is set to miss Napoli’s next European game against Rijeka in six days time. Napoli claimed a valuable three points thanks to a deflected strike from Politano ten minutes into the second half.
