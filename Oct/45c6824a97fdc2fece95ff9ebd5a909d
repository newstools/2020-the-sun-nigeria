Youth and Sports Development Minister, Mr. Sunday Dare, visited some youths who were injured during the recent EndSARS  protests in Lagos where  he promised that their complaints were  being  adequately adressed  by the Federal Government. Speaking during  a visit to the General Hospital in Victoria  Island, Lagos , Mr. Dare said:”  We sympathise  with all those that got injured during the protests  and commiserate  with those that lost  loved  ones. We believe  the struggle  is not in vain.Government   appreciates your right  to protest  legitimately which is part of our democratic  process. I feel your pains and government  is committed  to addressing  all the issues raised by the protesters.  While some have been adressed, others are being  looked into. But the Ministry  of Youth and Sports Development has 25  initiatives  that address  the  needs of the Youth. We shall explore  all avenues to engage  our youths constructively. Your voices  have been  heard.” “ There are on going refoms which would be deep and intensive .  Government  has a seat for youths at the negotiating  table. The youths must move away from the street and come to the negotiating table.”
