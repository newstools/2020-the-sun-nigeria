He affirmed that Chevron has been one of the largest Global Fund corporate partners and its partnership focuses on capacity development initiatives, joint advocacy and communications campaigns, and other local initiatives. “Chevron also encourages its staff to share their skills with the local programs to help improve grant reach and performance,” he added. He stated that Chevron’s $5 million investment from October 2017 has supported the national HIV and TB programmes in Nigeria, contributing significantly to the following national results by 2019: More than 1 million people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy
