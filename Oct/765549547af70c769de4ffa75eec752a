Schalke 04 had to settle for a 1-1 draw against visitors VfB Stuttgart on Friday after leading for the first time this season and have now gone 22 Bundesliga games without a win. The Royal Blues, who last week earned their first point of the season, looked sharper in the first half than in past weeks. They deservedly went ahead with 19-year-old Malick Thiaw’s diving header at the far post in the 30th minute. A handball play by Salif Sane gave the visitors a penalty kick in the 56th minute and Nicolas Gonzalez stepped up to equalise. Stuttgart then took complete control of the game, with Schalke 04 pulling back deep into their own half. They would have left with all three points were it not for Schalke 04 goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow’s fine saves late in the game. Stuttgart move up to fourth place on nine points while Schalke 04 are 17th with two points after six games. Leaders RB Leipzig, on 13 points, travel to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday when champions Bayern Munich, a point behind, visit struggling Cologne. (Reuters/NAN)
