Fred Itua, Abuja Despite opposition, the Senate yesterday, confirmed  President  Muhammadu Buhari’s nominations  for  appointments  as Chairman, Director-General and Commissioners of National  Pension  Commission(PenCom). The confirmation was sequel to the presentation and consideration of the report of Senate  Committee on Establishment and  Public  Service  Matters. The report  was presented  by  the Vice-Chairman of the  Committee, Mpigi Barinada. Presenting  the  report,  Barinaga  said  the committee screened  and found  the nominees  worthy  of the appointments. He, however, said that the committee recommended  that the  nominee from Katsina should  be stood  down  because  she was yet  to present  her  National Youth  Service Corps certificate (NYSC) to the committee. Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, who alongside Southern lawmakers, opposed the confirmation of the of the Director-General, Aisha Dahir-Umar, noted that  the nominee  should  have been  picked  from  the South East  region, following  the non completion  of the tenure  of the former  head who was from the region. Ali Ndume and Aishatu Dahiru, both from North East where the Dahir-Umar hails from, argued  that  it was within the prerogative  of President  Buhari  to appoint people into positions based  on existing  laws.
