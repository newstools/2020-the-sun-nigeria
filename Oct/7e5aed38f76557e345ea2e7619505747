Axion Entertainment in partnership with a US-based company has released a blockbuster movie titled, Endless Revenge. According to the producer, Prince Ifeanyi Dike, the message of the movie cannot be down played, as it is a big issue in the society today. “The story is about a nun that was raped after which hell was let loose. I don’t want to give out details of the movie but it teaches a lot of lessons. By the time you watch this movie, there will be no more rape because there is a hanging message there. Axion Entertainment has now come into the system to stay, and part of our target is to discover new stars like Debbie Nwachukwu in this film. Watch out for her.” Endless Revenge, which is set to hit the shelves in December, will premiere in Lagos, Owerri and Michigan, USA. It parades top stars like Segun Arinze, Prince Ifeanyi Dike, and Dupe Noma among others.
