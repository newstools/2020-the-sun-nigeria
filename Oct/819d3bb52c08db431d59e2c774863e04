Derek Chisora believes he will get the chance to fight Tyson Fury for a third time if he manages to defeat Oleksandr Usyk next week. A shot at a world title is on the line when the British heavyweight takes on his Ukrainian counterpart on Saturday, October 31. WBO mandatory challenger Usyk is already set to face unified champion Anthony Joshua, but Chisora is already looking beyond fighting him and pursuing a trilogy clash with WBC champion Fury if he emerges victorious. ‘I think it would be a great fight to have with ‘The Gypsy King’, because he’s always promised me a third fight,’ Chisora told Sky Sports. ‘He owes me anyway, because we speak every day, and he owes me that fight. ‘He’s always saying he wants to give me another fight, so he’s a man of his word, so that would be the fight I would like to have.’ Fury defeated Chisora in their previous two fights, winning on points at the Wembley Arena in July 2011, before winning with a 10th-round retirement at London’s Excel Arena in November 2014. Chisora nevertheless claims he holds a good relationship with Fury, while also stating he maintains regular contact with Joshua. ‘You know what, I get on with everybody, but when it comes to fight, it’s fight time. ‘It’s just business. After all, when the gloves are off, it’s all hugs and kisses, so if it happens, it happens.’ @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Ilaji Resort to host WBF World Boxing title bout The Chairman and CEO of the prestigious Ilaji Sports and Resort Ibadan, Mr. Dotun Sanusi has given his nod to the hosting of the historic World Boxing Federation (WBF) International Super Featherweight Title bout between Ridwan Oyekola (Nigeria) and Jose Ramos Savin (Spain) slated for 27th December 2020.

In a signed statement, Group Managing Director of Complete Sports, Dr. Mumini Alao, said: “The hoodlums came very early on Sunday morning, 25 October, 2020. They attacked our office security guards, tied them up and proceeded to ransack several offices in the building. Luckily for us, one of the guards escaped to raise the alarm, thus forcing the fleeing hoodlums to abandon some of their loot, including a Toyota Corolla car, Apple desktop, HP laptop and several GSM phones taken from our premises. “The incident has been reported at the Okota Police station, while two of our personnel that were injured by the hoodlums have been treated at a private hospital.” Complete Sports is the pioneer all-sports publication in Nigeria.

A spokesperson for the IOC confirmed Bach would not attend tomorrow’s ceremony in person and would instead take part virtually. Bach had been due to travel to Seoul to accept the prize, which he was awarded for his role in staging the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang. Pyeongchang 2018 saw South Korea and North Korea march together in the Opening Ceremony, while the two countries, still technically at war, also combined to form a joint women’s ice hockey team. “Because of the deteriorating situation in Switzerland and Europe, which makes travelling even more difficult, the IOC President, together with the IOC and the Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, has decided that his participation in the award ceremony on Monday would be virtual,” the IOC spokesperson said. The visit to Seoul to accept the award – established in 1990 to commemorate the success of the 1988 Olympics in the South Korean capital of Seoul, celebrating the harmony and friendship of competition – was set to be Bach’s longest trip since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Typically Bach is a frequent international traveller, but restrictions imposed across the world have forced him to conduct business remotely over the past seven months. The IOC President is planning a trip to Tokyo next month to meet new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga but no dates have been confirmed. He has not been able to visit the Japanese capital to inspect preparations for the postponed Olympic and Paralympic Games since the coronavirus pandemic ground international travel to a halt, but World Athletics President Sebastian Coe went to Tokyo earlier this month. Bach’s last trip was a short visit to Imola to attend the International Cycling Union Road World Championships last month. @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ Tokyo 2020 Torches to be put on display Torches for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games are to be put on public display in what organizers have called “a wonderful opportunity to see these valuable items up close”. A touring exhibition is set to begin on November 2nd at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government (TMG) office. The torches can be seen in the Olympics and Paralympics Flags exhibition. They will remain on display until November 10th before beginning a tour of the 62 municipalities of Tokyo. The exhibition is set to open each day from 9.30 am to 6.15 pm local time and will include an example of the torches used for both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. “Visitors will not be permitted to handle the torches,” Tokyo 2020 said. Those attending the exhibition have been asked for their cooperation “with measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and ensure safety”. Tokyo 2020 added “infection control measures will be in place at each venue based on the TMG’s roadmap to overcoming COVID-19”. Organisers plan  for the tour to last until July 3rd. The final exhibition will be at the Shinjuku Sports Center but they have warned the scheduled exhibition “may be suspended in the future depending on the novel coronavirus situation”. The original flame has been displayed in a safety lamp at the Japan Olympic Museum in Tokyo since the beginning of September. It had been kindled from the rays of the sun at Ancient Olympia in March. Organisers plan for the Torch Relay to begin on March 25th next year at the J-Village in Fukushima. Some 10,000 runners are expected to carry the flame across Japan as it makes its way to Tokyo for the Olympic Opening Ceremony on July 23 2021. The Games have been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
