Super Eagles midfielder, John Ogu has asked his teammates to boycott the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone next month, Bestchoicesports.com.ng reports. The former Hapoel Be’er Sheva player made the call via his Twitter, following the bloodletting and mass killing of innocent Nigeria youths in Lagos and across the country who were protesting against police brutality and bad governance.

Nigerian youths as well as players have been severally brutalised and killed by the untamed SARS officials in the country.
