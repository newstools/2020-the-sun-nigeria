Zika Bobby The Nigeria Customs Service, Area ll Command, Onne Port, Rivers State generated a total of N13,106,025,050.24  in the month of September 2020.

According to Comptroller Auwal Mohammed, “this feat is a combination of efforts by my very diligent officers and men who are unrelenting in the discharge of their duties.” “The revenue outcome is also a confirmation of my observation on my first day in office here that I am taking over a very functional command with systems for revenue generation, trade facilitation and suppression of smuggling.” “In my interactions with officers and port users, I harped on the need for compliance and reiterated my insistence on due process at all times by everyone interfacing with customs in the course of trade.” “I am whole heatedly committed to achieving maximum collection of all revenue due to government through Customs duties in Onne Port and prevent any form of leakages. Where shortfalls are detected, I pursue uncompromising recovery through demand notice (DN) to prevent revenue loss. ”While I consider our over N13 billion revenue generated as a laudable feat, it doesn’t call for complacency on our part. It is only a reminder to do more in our national interest to support the country’s economic well being,’ he said.
