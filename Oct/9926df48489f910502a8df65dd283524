Tony John, Port Harcourt The Sole Administrator, Rivers State Waste Management Agency (RIWAMA), Felix Obuah, has announced strict restriction of human and vehicular movements during today’s monthly clean-up exercise. He declared yesterday that this month’s statewide sanitation exercise would hold today, across the 23 local government areas of the state from 7am to 10am. He reiterated the ban on movements of people and vehicles during the period of the exercise, warning that defaulters would be arrested and prosecuted. Obuah enjoined all council chairmen in the 23 local governments, councillors, paramount rulers, community development committees (CDCs), youth councils and other groups to ensure full participation of the people in their respective areas. He appealed to security agencies, particularly Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs), to strictly enforce the restriction of human and vehicular movement order during the period across the state. He also enjoined all Rivers people and those living and doing business in the state to comply accordingly by using the period to clean their environment, surroundings and empty their gutters and other water channels for free flow of water, as defaulters will be arrested and prosecuted. He further warned against converting the period of the sanitation exercise to street trading, physical training, footballing and other social activities, stressing that defaulters would be arrested and prosecuted before the Sanitation Court that would be sitting at the RIWAMA premises today. He implored truck owners, individuals and corporate organizations, to make available their trucks for evacuation of wastes that would be generated during the sanitation exercise.
