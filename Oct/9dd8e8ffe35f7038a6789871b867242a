Chief Executive Officer of Rich World Entertainment, promoters of the show, Bright Ezih, confirmed that the state government has put everything in place to ensure the successful hosting of the event. He said: “As the name implies, it’s one that has the full backing and involvement of the Enugu State government. What this means is that government has put everything in place. Government also gave us guidelines that we must meet. For instance, people usually make promises in this kind of event and they don’t fulfill such promises. So, the government mandated that we bring out the star prize and others before we kick-off. This, we have done, as we didn’t just unveil the star prize but every other prize is there.”
