Laide Raheem, Abeokuta Three persons narrowly escaped being burnt to death as the engine of a tanker conveying about 50,000 litres of petrol caught fire on Saturday in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital. The incident occured on the early morning of Saturday, in front of the Ogun State Governorâ€™s Office, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Sunday Sun gathered that the tanker was traveling from Ijora in Lagos State enroute to Adatan Area in the Abeokuta metropolis when the incident took place.
The driver of the tanker, Nurudeen Yusuf, was reported to have told bystanders that he, alongside his two motorboys discovered a spark from the engine, which resulted in the fire outbreak. It was further gathered that men of the Ogun State Fire Service, stationed at Oke Mosan rescued the occupants of the tanker. The team leader of the Federal Fire Service at the scene, Sodiq Atanda, said that it took the timely intervention of his men to put out the fire before it got to the body of the truck, which according to him, could have caused serious explosion. Atanda, however, lamented that the truck did not have a fire extinguisher which could come handy in such situation.
