Fred Itua, Abuja Enugu indigenes resident in the Russian Federation have petitioned Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi over rising cases of land racketeering and their resultant effects. In the letter signed by the president of the body, Mr Emmanuel Moses, they complained in the entire South-East, Enugu State ranks number one in land grabbing. They said the practice has become a top menu for government officials. ‘This is nauseating and, to say the least, disgraceful, for individuals who have received the mandate to administer our commonwealth,’ part of the letter read. The letter further read: ‘We are dragging the focus of the international community to this dastardly act and pledge not to fold our arms and watch this devilish and wicked act by the Hon. Commissioner of Housing, go unpunished. ‘Let it be known that this parochial act of wickedness cannot be interpreted otherwise. It is a direct affront on our common sensibilities as well as a pure invitation to anarchy and does not in the slightest of ways portray any regard for the dignity of human rights and civility. ‘We are more than convinced, beyond reasonable doubt that, Your Excellency, the Governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, whom we have high respect and regard for, may not have been properly briefed and addressed on this ongoing saga that has culminated for months, hence this clarion call for you to urgently intervene. ‘We remain optimistic that, Your Excellency’s timely intervention will go a long way to quell the already heated tension generated as a result of the misgivings and excessive abuse of office.’
