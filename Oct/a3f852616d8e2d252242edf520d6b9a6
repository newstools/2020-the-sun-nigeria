They have attacked Amukoko Division, Liami division. Right now, they are attacking Ago/Okota Police Station while we watch as they destroy our stations. ‘The annoying thing is that the CP has now made a u-turn directing that we should defend our stations. We don’t know the directives to follow. What does he mean by the late directives? This is an affront on us, beating some of our men like schoolboys and looting our armouries.’
