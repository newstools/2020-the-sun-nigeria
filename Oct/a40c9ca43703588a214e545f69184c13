Uche Usim, Abuja Following the slight slump in the price of crude oil in the international market, there are strong indications that the pump price of petrol is likely to dip in October. Anxious Nigerians are waiting for  the price band of petrol for October, even though the federal government says it no longer fixes prices of petroleum products but will monitor the oil marketers to ensure they do not prey on hapless consumers in a deregulated environment. Sources at the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) said that they anticipate a reduction in the ex-depot price of petroleum for this month as the brent crude dropped from $40 per barrel to $39. 38 on Friday. They added that the PPMC was expected to make some pronouncement on the matter to guide the marketers.

In all, he stated that the Nigerian government would no longer fix prices but allow market forces determine same.

At that time, brent crude had appreciated to $46 per barrel.
