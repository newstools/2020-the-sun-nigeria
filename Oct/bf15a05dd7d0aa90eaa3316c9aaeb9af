A leading member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Sam Nkire, has debunked insinuations that the party was disintegrating or  would disintegrate before the next general elections in 2023. Chief Nkire, who is a member of the National Caucus of the APC, said it was regrettable that even some senior members of the party, including some notable people who had held top positions in government, were among the doom’s day prophets. “It is regrettable, although not totally depressing, that senior members of this party who have held top positions in this government were among the band of doom’s day prophets, wishing the party dead.” Nkire warned that it would not be long before the party began to sanction such members who demonstrate lack of respect for the party and by implication, President Muhammamadu Buhari who is the leader of the All Progressives Congress. The Abia State-born politician reassured Nigerians that everything politically and lawfully necessary, would be done by the leadership of the APC to boost the strength and membership of the ruling party, in the coming days. Nkire said the focus and attention of every member or lover of APC should be on winning the governorship election in Ondo State, adding, “Edo was a painful loss, Ondo is a task that must be done.”
