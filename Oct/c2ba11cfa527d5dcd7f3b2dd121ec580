Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare,  alongside ministers from selected countries, yesterday, had an online meeting with the top brass of the world football  governing body, FIFA, where it was agreed that a new course  must be taken to ensure youth football development. Speaking during the third edition of the Town Hall meeting  with Nigerian youths, Dare said: “The Ministry  of Youth and Sports Development is working with the Nigerian Football  Federation, in collaboration with the La Liga, to organise  training for coaches. We have asked the NFF to expand this programme to ensure that young coaches get proper training. I will take the message of youth coaches training back to the NFF, so that this can be expanded. The National Institute for Sports also trains quality coaches. We encourage youths to attend regular trainings.”
