He was speaking with journalists at Command Guest House, Bauchi, on Tuesday shortly after he declared closed the maiden Health Summit in the state . “So many things happened that have raised our population to seven and eight million people and our health system has collapsed and we need to look at it in terms of what we would do to renovate, incentivize what is available in terms of financing, in terms of good drug revolving scheme that will be able to put health under one roof,” he said. “We have a peculiar situation. We are a peaceful state, many are migrating here willingly and we are bordered by several states. We are a gateway to the north east and north central. We must be able to look at all the issues and make Bauchi the next health destination and reduce capital flight” Mohammed said the health summit was a fulfillment of the promise made by his administration and the vision he has for the Bauchi State health sector. “We want to deepen collaboration and stockholding with a view to looking at all the areas that have to be looked at in terms of closing the gaps in infrastructure, services human capital with a view to taking health system and health services to the highest level,” he said.
