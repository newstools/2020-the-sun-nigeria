Lagos State governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced this while addressing the EndSARS protesters at the Lagos House of Assembly gate, Alausa, Ikeja. The compensation fund will be completely supervised by Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) appointed by members of the public. Sanwo-Olu called on the protesers to send the list of everyone that had fatal encounters with SARS in Lagos. He said that government would identify the families and ensure that they were compensated.

He said that in fulfilment of one of the requests made by the protesters, all those arrested had been released without any condition. Sanwo-Olu further promised to convey the requests of the protesters to President Muhammadu Buhari, some of which are increment in police salary, as well as Justice for those killed by the Police.
