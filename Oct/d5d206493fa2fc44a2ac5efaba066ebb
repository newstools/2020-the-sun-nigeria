He said this at a meeting with the management staff of the institute at their headquarters in Abuja, when he officially assumed duty.

Alhaji Kangiwa charged the staff and members of the institute to support him without fear or bias, in his drive to reposition the organisation in Nigeria and West Africa. He said, “You  need be assured that I will work within the principles of the United Nations of being non-sectional. As such, be rest assured that I am fully gender-blind, tribal-blind. religious-blind and non-parochial in life and in my work ethics. I have always been true to this principle in my previous appointments, both in public and private sectors, and this time around, I shall be much more so.
