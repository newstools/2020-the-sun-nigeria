Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick is confident that Super Eagles will win the next African Cup of Nations. Pinnick spoke to brila.net on the team’s chances of becoming African champions again as they are on the verge of qualifying for the tournament in Cameroon. The Super Eagles finished third in the last edition in Egypt, but  currently sit on top of their qualifying group for the next edition with six solid points. The team could seal their place for the Cameroon 2022 showpiece should they see off neighbours, Sierra Leone, in next month’s doubleheaders. The first meeting is scheduled for Samuel Ogbemudia stadium in Benin and the reverse fixture in Free town. “We are more confident now that Nigeria Super eagles will go places, we will not only qualify for the nation’s cup but win it, I’m one hundred commuted by God’s grace we will win that nation’s cup,” Pinnick told Brila. “Next year is going to be a very strong, critical and very sensitive era for football based on the number of qualifications that we are going to have both the nation’s cup qualifiers and the world cup qualifiers so, it’s going to be a very tight year, we need to have a retinue of players,” he concluded.
