Winger Kingsley Coman scored twice and set up another goal as holders Bayern Munich crushed Atletico Madrid 4-0 in the UEFA Champions League Group A opener on Wednesday. The win stretched Bayern Munichâ€™s winning run in the competition to 12 games. The France international put the hosts ahead with a fine effort in the 28th minute and then set up Leon Goretzka to fire in their second in the 41st minute. Fellow France international Corentin Tolisso killed off any Spanish hopes of a comeback with a sensational shot in the 66th minute. Coman then twice shook off defender Felipe to bag his second goal of the evening six minutes later. Bayern Munich, who had won all 11 of their games en route to the UEFA Champions League title last season, are top on three points in the group. Lokomotiv Moscow and Salzburg are on one point each following their 2-2 draw. The Germans were without their in-form winger Serge Gnabry, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday. But they still enjoyed a whirlwind start and hit the post with Niklas Suele in the 15th minute. Coman did it much better 13 minutes later when he latched onto a Joshua Kimmich cross to score with a fine finish. He then set up Goretzka whose slightly-deflected shot beat goalkeeper Jan Oblak. Atletico Madrid were with only two wins from their previous 10 away games in the group stage of the competition and also without striker Diego Costa. They came close just once in the entire first half with Luis Suarez. Joao Felix did find the back of the net right after the restart but his effort was disallowed for offside. The Portuguese then launched a solo run in the 65th minute before laying the ball on for Yannick Carrasco, who waited far too long to finish the move. They were punished for the wasted chance a minute later with Tolisso firing an unstoppable missile from 25 metres. Coman then added their fourth goal in the 72nd minute.(Reuters/NAN)
