(Reuters/NAN) Bayern Munich’s Joshua Kimmich volleyed in a 79th-minute winner on Tuesday as they battled past hosts Lokomotiv Moscow 2-1 in their UEFA Champions League Group A match. The result helped to extend their winning run in the competition to 13 consecutive games. Leon Goretzka headed them in front in the 13th minute but they squandered a string of chances to double their lead and also hit the post. Then, Anton Miranchuk punished their wastefulness following a quick break from Ze Luis. Bayern Munich, winners of five trophies in 2020, are top of their group on six points, after also beating Atletico Madrid 4-0 last week in their opener. The Russians, who have one point, had the first good chance through Fyodor Smolov’s third-minute header. But Bayern Munich’s Goretzka did better, heading in a perfect Benjamin Pavard cross. Kingsley Coman then struck the foot of the post 10 minutes later after an identical assist from Pavard, with the Russians clearly struggling with Bayern Munich’s pace down the wings. Kimmich should have done better when he fired at a defender from two metres out early in the second half, but the midfielder then made amends 11 minutes from the end. With Lokomotiv Moscow pressing for a second goal, he picked up the ball on the edge of the box and with his back to the goal, flicked it up, pivoted and volleyed in the winner. Bayern Munich next visits Salzburg while Lokomotiv Moscow, who have lost six of their last seven home games in the Champions League group stage, host Atletico Madrid.
