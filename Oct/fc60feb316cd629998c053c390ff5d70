Fast rising role interpreter, Omotola Odunsi better known as Motola The Actor, is single and ready to mingle. Making this known in a chat with Inside Nollywood, the beautiful actress says, “I’m very single and ready to mingle. I had to choose between my boyfriend and my job, because he couldn’t understand the deep passion I have for my career. My ex refused to understand that I am not emotionally attached to the characters I play in movies. When playing romantic roles, I just have to portray what the director wants and makes it appear real. That is what makes me a professional. But he wasn’t cool with it, so he said he was scared of losing me. He forced me to choose between him and my job.” Miss Odunsi also averred that though, she had encountered countless randy movie producers and directors, her talent, not just her beauty will take her to greater heights. “I’m not desperate to attain fame. Lots of Nollywood producers and directors are always running after me. They are either asking me out or asking for sex. But I am not in the industry for that. In fact, I had to resign from banking in 2019 because of my passion for acting, so I wouldn’t jeopardize it by sleeping around. I have what it takes to get up there. It has not been easy, but with God, I shall continue to excel,” she avows.
