The Catholic Church on Sunday conducted ‘Restoration Mass’  during which the parishioners  prayed to God to restore individuals and the nation’s economy disrupted by the Coronavirus pandemic . Rev. Fr. Godfrey Udeh, the  Parish Priest of Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Tedi, Lagos, in his homily on ‘Restoration’  during the Mass advised Nigerians to  go to God in prayers for the  restoration of the nation’s economy. According to him, this is necessary to aid the  return to normal lifestyles of the people of the world. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos  reports that the social-economic lockdown that happened following  the outbreak of the pandemic in March in Nigeria  up to the end of second quarter of 2020, rendered the economy comatose ; with many losing jobs and investments. Udeh said that there was an urgent need to rebuild Nigeria’s economy after the pandemic; create jobs for people and wealth for the nation for the society to bounce back. He urged people to be innovative  and constantly improve on what they do to attract more patronage. The priest said that people should look inward for investment opportunities in the agro-allied sector  to bring the economy back on track. ”It  is only God that can overturn doom predictions and change such to blessings. In  that wise, we should beckon on to  him through prayers to heal our land and restore our failing economy. “Since he preserved our lives during the pandemic, he is ever ready to turn our fortune better. For he can give the wisdom to make wealth and  to make provisions for his people,” he said. Udeh said that Nigerians should pray for God’s guidance for  the leadership of the country so that they would always come up with good policies. He appealed to Nigerians from all-walks-of-life to continue to maintain all COVID-19 preventive protocols until the pandemic had been  completely defeated. (NAN)
