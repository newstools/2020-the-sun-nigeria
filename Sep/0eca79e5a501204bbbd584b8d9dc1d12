The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) Academy has been recertified and its accreditation renewed as a training service provider for various professionals in the banking industry for the next three years, with effect from last June, by the Council of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN). The recertification, according to Mr. Saubana Ogunpola, Head of the five-man CIBN Accreditation Team, followed the exemplary performance of the NDIC Academy since its initial accreditation in 2016 and the satisfaction of the stringent conditions for the recertification. He noted there would be periodic monitoring to ensure that quality standards are being adhered to. Ogunpola commended the NDIC for its consistent efforts toward meeting high standards for the benefit of the banking industry and the larger economy. He described the NDIC’s readiness to subject itself to the rigours of the institute’s accreditation process as a testimony of its management’s commitment to capacity development for all stakeholders. Reacting to the development, NDIC’s Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Umaru Ibrahim, described the recertification as another milestone in the NDIC efforts to consolidate the position of the Academy as a centre of academic excellence in the nation’s banking industry and on deposit insurance in Africa. Ibrahim disclosed that the Academy had so far trained a total of 13,368 participants cut across the NDIC’s workforce. It had also trained 135 participants from relevant stakeholders, including the EFCC, Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON), National Pension Commission (PENCOM) and the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).  On the international front, 19 employees from sister deposit insurance agencies in African had benefitted from the expertise of the Academy.
