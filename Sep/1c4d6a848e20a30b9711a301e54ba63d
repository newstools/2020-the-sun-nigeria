The spokesman added that preliminary medical examination on the suspect’s mental condition revealed no trace of mental disorder, saying that the suspect would be taken to a Psychiatric Hospital to properly ascertain his mental health status. According to him, the suspect will be charged to court after completion of investigation. (NAN)
