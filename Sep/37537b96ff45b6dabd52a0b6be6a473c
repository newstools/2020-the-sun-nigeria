Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State on Tuesday has called on the Federal Government to come to the aid of the State in order to tackle the insecurity situation it is grappling with. The Governor made this known to State House Correspondents at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, after a private meeting over the security situation in the State with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Ishaku said he came to brief the vice president on the security situation in the state and seek his assistance. ‘It is about security… the problems of security that we have in the State. ‘I briefed him and we are hoping that he will look into it. ‘Just in general; there is Jukun/Tiv; there is also kidnapping, which is on the rise, and all the others. ‘In general form, I think he is fully briefed and I think he will be able to assist us.’ He said he got a positive response from the vice president and expressed optimism that the situation would be addressed. On COVID-19, he said that the state had yet to record any death. ‘We had some cases, but they were all treated and they have all been discharged and new ones are come. ‘Luckily, the NCDC, after our complaint, brought us a testing laboratory; it was inaugurated Tuesday. ‘In the near future, I will be more authoritative in saying how many people are infected, how many people are treated. ‘So, now we have a lab in Jalingo and we are hoping to have a second lab in Takum, in the southern part,’ he said.
