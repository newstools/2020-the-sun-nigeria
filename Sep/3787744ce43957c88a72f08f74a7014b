While Nlemigbo who is presently enjoying the support of Governor Hope Uzodimma has boasted that he has all the aspirants identified with him, Nwafor is also confident that the election would be well conducted. However, Nwafor, has advised all those participating in the said primary election to toe the part of the constitution and the rule of law, just as he assured that nothing will usurp the primary election.
