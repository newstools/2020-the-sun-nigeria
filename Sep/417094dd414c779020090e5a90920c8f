Fred Itua, Abuja The management of TStv, a local satellite television network, has said that it will on October 1, roll out pay-per-view services in 18 states to mark the country’s independence. Managing Director Bright Echefuz said the company had surmounted the challenges it encountered after its launch in October 2017 and was better positioned to deliver quality services to Nigerians. He said the company since 2017 went back to the drawing board to address all lapses to give Nigerians value for money and that while services will begin in 18 states on October 1, the remaining states will enjoy services from October 10. He said: “While we were off the radar, we properly studied the business and we have created a model to fit every Nigerian’s desire. We have created the pay as you view model where Nigerians will pay only for the channels they want to watch. Echefu also said as a gift to Nigerians for their steadfastness and understanding, the company had made the Grande Sports Extra Channel and some other local channels free to all Nigerians for one year. He also commended the Federal Government for giving the company the desired support to start again after the challenges that led to its failure when it was first launched.
