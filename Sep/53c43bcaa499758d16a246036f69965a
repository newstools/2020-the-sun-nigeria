The APC alleged that from its findings, Justice Taiwo has a close relationship with Rivers State Governor Mr Nyesom Wike, the Chairman of Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council in the Edo gubernatorial poll. The party alleged further that Governor Wike had openly boosted that he would do everything humanly possible to ensure that PDP win the poll by influencing the disqualification of Ize-Iyamu through the court.
