Meanwhile, the agency has warned that majority of Nigerian states were not testing enough. It said, “We do not have enough data coming out of these states to ascertain if we are improving or not or where exactly we are. “So we have to work together; in summary, it is way too early to make any interpretation whether we are flattening the curve or not.” The NCDC appealed to more states to test consistently so that progress could be monitored on a national level.
