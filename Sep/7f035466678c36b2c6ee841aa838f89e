Speaking at events marking the handing over of the cheques, National Sales Director, Dangote Cement Plc,  Mr Adeyemi Fajobi, said the new entrepreneurs will support the economy and create more jobs for the country’s unemployed. Similarly Dangote Cement Marketing Director, Mrs. Funmi Sanni, in her speech, said only the company has the capacity to inject such huge amounts of money into the economy. Sanni, who observed that  several promos being promised run by some companies under the facade of business promotion regrettably  turned out to be scams and decoys contrived to dupe customers, assuring that the ongoing promo was real and impactful.
