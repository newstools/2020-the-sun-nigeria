Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos The Lagos State Government has approved the reopening of cinemas and gyms as soon as possible, with a maximum of thirty-three per cent (33%) occupancy. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced this during a briefing in on Saturday. Like most public places, cinemas and other recreational outlets were shut in March to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. But while some public places like markets, banks, airports, amongst others have been allowed to reopen, cinemas, beaches and other places of relaxation remain closed. Speaking on the development, Governor Sanwo-Olu said: ‘Henceforth, cinemas and gyms are permitted to reopen as soon as possible, with a maximum of thirty-three per cent (33%) occupancy, which means that there must be a minimum of two empty seats between occupied seats; and in the case of gyms, there must be constant disinfection of machines and equipment throughout the course of the day. ‘Next month, October, we will announce the decisions regarding the reopening of other sectors of the economy: night-clubs, bars, event centres, spas, public parks and so on. For now, these will continue to remain closed, until fixed plans for reopening are announced in October 2020. ‘As regards our places of worship, we are now also permitting the mosques to resume their five-times-a-day prayers, and in the case of churches, they are now also permitted to resume their mid-week services.
