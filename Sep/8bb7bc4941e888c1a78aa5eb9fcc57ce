From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has condemned alleged siege on opposition governors by security agents in Benin City, the Edo State capital, ahead of Saturday’s gubernatorial election in the state.

” The caucus wishes to draw the attention of Mr president to immediately wade into the matter and allow the people of Edo state to vote leaders of fhier choice ”
” We also want to use this medium to draw the attention of the nation and the international community of the security siege on PDP governors in Benin City.”
