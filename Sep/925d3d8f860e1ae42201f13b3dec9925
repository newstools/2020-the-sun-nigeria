The Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KADIRS), says the state government has concluded plans to shut down illegal motor parks across the state, as part of efforts to improve Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). The Executive Chairman of the service, Dr Zaid Abubakar made this known in an interview with newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday. Abubakar noted with dismay the proliferation of illegal motor parks across the state, adding that the responsible agencies in charge of parks and transportation would begin clamp down the parks by next week. “All illegal motor parks are going to be closed by the responsible agencies by next week,  and revenues from the parks will increase because there will be centralisation of collection. “At the moment; we are not getting the revenues we are supposed to get from the parks because they are operating illegally. “The closure will, therefore, improve our collection efficiency,” he said. According to him, the revenue agency will fully implement the state tax law to ensure that all businesses operating in the state pay the needed taxes to the state government. Abubakar advised taxpayers on voluntary compliance to their tax obligation to enable the government improve on security, provision of basic social services as well as execute viable development projects to improve the wellbeing of the people. “KADIRS will enforce compliance with the provisions of the law and strengthen revenue collection mechanisms in the state.” (NAN)
