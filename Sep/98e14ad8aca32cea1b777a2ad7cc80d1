4G LTE Internet service provider, Spectranet 4G LTE, has unveiled a unique set of data plans tagged “Do More Spectracular Data Plans” to address the changing data requirements of its customers as a result of the new normal of working from home (WFH). Speaking on the virtual launch of DO MORE SpectraCular Data Plans, Ajay Awasthi, Chief Executive Officer, Spectranet 4G LTE said, “our study of the customer behaviour during COVID-19 period highlighted a distinct shift in the browsing habits and usage patterns.
