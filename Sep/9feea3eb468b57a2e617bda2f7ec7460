In the letter of objection, which was coped to the President, Muhammad Buhari, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Assembly and the Debt Management Office among others, Tofa held that the state would be indebted to Chaina for several years to come if the loan deal was allowed to scale through. He also expressed concern over the ambiguity surrounding the said loan saying that except for a few people in official circles, the terms and condition of the said facility were not available to the members of the public. Tofa held that going by the present indebtedness of the state government as provided by the Debt Management Office, it would be extremely impossible for the state government to shoulder any additional liability beyond the current liability.
