Contrary to the insinuation that there will be violence during the election in Edo North, there is peace and calmness at Ughioli Primary School Ward 7, Aviele in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State where the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate, Gani Audu is going to cast his vote though he is yet to arrive to perform his civic right. The electorate have since queued up to cast their votes. The security personnel are vincible everywhere to quell any forms of violence that might tend to arise from any quarters but surprisingly, the people of the community see themselves as one big and unified family. Moreso, the election is serving as a blessing to the people of the quarter as they are busy selling their wares and making money for themselves. Certainly, they are going to smile to the bank next week Monday.
