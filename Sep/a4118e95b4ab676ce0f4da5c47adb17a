Osimhen has already proved his class at Napoli after netting six times in two pre-season outings for the Blues. The Nigeria international scored a hat-trick in his first appearance for the club against L’Aquilla last week and followed that up with another three goals versus Teramo, on Friday. “Preseason Done But Hardwork ContinuesGOD Is The GreatestWe Move @sscnapoli,” Osimhen wrote on his Twitter handle. Napoli have lined up two more friendlies against Pescara and Sporting Lisbon before the start of the season. Gattuso’s men will travel to Parma for their opening fixture of the 2020/21 season on September 20.
