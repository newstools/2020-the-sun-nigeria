Flash floods from River Niger have submerged over 70 communities and displaced over 50,000 from their houses in different parts of Kogi. Residents of some of the communities who spoke in Lokoja said the communities had been experiencing massive flooding in the last five days. They told NAN on the sidelines of a stakeholders sensitisation/advocacy meeting on 2020 flood that the flood had wreaked havoc in the affected areas. The one-day meeting was organised by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in partnership with the Kogi State Emergency Management Agency (KOSEMA). One of the residents, Mr Ibrahim Abdullahi, who is also the Desk Officer in charge of ecological and emergency matters in Kogi Local Government Council, said that 66 communities had been submerged by flood in the area. Abdullahi said that over 50,000 people had been forced to evacuate their houses and were now being accommodated in schools , filling stations and other makeshift buildings. He said some of the victims in Edeha and Koton Karfe communities had been sleeping on roads and other open places, co-habiting with mosquitoes and dangerous reptiles. He said that schools had been closed as they had been converted to temporary camps for the victims, calling for urgent intervention from the State Government and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
