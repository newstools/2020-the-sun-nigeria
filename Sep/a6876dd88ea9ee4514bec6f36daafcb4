Nigerian soccer legend, Kanu Nwankwo, was yesterday, unveiled as an ambassador for Simba TVS, distributors of Nigeria’s leading brands in the tricycle, motorcycle and power bike sector. At a well attended signing ceremony held at the Simba TVS motorcycle and tricycle plant at Ogba, Ikeja, Kanu  commended the company’s role in the development of the country’s economy. The Olympic gold medal-winning Nigerian Dream Team captain said: “I am extremely happy to be associated with Simba TVS. I know the company and have seen their contributions to both the development of the motorcycle and tricycle sector and, especially, their empowerment programme for dealers, customers and riders who patronise their products. While endorsing Simba’s products, the soccer legend said, “I have the singular honour and privilege of recommending their products- the TVS King tricycle, the HLX+ motorcycle and the Apache Power Bike, first and foremost because of their quality and as well for their after sales service policy demonstrated in their workshops spread all over Nigeria.”
