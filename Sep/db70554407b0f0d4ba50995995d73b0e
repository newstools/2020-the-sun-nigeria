The product, which offers customers the ability to control their fuel and energy purchases, is in line with the company’s objective of leveraging technology to revolutionise Nigeria’s downstream sector. Velox is a wallet-based payment solution accessible to corporates and individuals through a dedicated card or sticker and is specifically designed to bring ease, transparency and control of purchases within Enyo’s products and services portfolio. Tailored to fit each customer’s requirements, Velox offers customizable solutions, including when and how payments are made, ability to set consumption and credit limits, as well as monitoring consumption.
