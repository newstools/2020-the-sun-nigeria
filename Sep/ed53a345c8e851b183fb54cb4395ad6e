Union Bank Nigeria Limited has objected to the ways and manners its Lokoja branch was shut by the Kogi State Internal Revenue Service (KIRS). The bank explained in a statement that it would respond, through the appropriate channels, in an effort to ensure fair and proper assessment, and subsequently, prompt resolution of the situation and reduce the inconvenience to customers. The statement read in part: “As an institution with a proven track record of responsible corporate citizenship, it takes civic obligations seriously. For the benefit of our customers, the press, and members of the general public, we wish to state the following, with regard to the above-mentioned incident. “Occasionally, as in this case, we may disagree with state entities over the objectivity of tax assessments carried out relating to our business. These are typically resolved through rigorous professional reviews and audits, and sometimes through legal channels. “We are therefore disappointed that in this instance, the Kogi State Internal Revenue Service  has chosen to escalate the issue rather than work through a professional review process to seek a prudent resolution. “We are directing our response through the appropriate channels as our objective is to ensure fair and proper assessment, and subsequently, prompt resolution of the situation to reduce the inconvenience to our customers.”  The bank then urged customers impacted by the closure to choose convenient digital channels – UnionOnline, UnionMobile and *826# – which are available 24/7 for their banking needs.
